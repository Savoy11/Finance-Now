# Finance Now — Multi-Asset Financial Analytics
## Claude Code Project Guide

This file is auto-loaded by Claude Code at session start. It gives instant context so you can make changes without re-exploring the codebase.

## What This Is

An institutional-grade financial analytics suite built with Next.js 15 (App Router). It began as a crypto dashboard (risk, reserves, news sentiment, transfer fees, staking) and has grown into an entitlement-gated module suite (see `docs/ROADMAP.md`): a **core** section (headlines, watchlist, portfolios, compare, research, brief) plus **five** optional modules — **Crypto** (the original Finance Now), **Equities** (`/equities`), **Macro Markets** (`/macro`), **ETFs & Funds** (`/funds`), and the premium **Portfolio Builder** (`/portfolio-builder`, its own entitlement). (This said "seven" while listing five; `lib/modules/registry.ts` is the count that matters — `core` plus those five.) Modules are declared in `src/lib/modules/registry.ts`; the sidebar renders from that registry, modules can be toggled in Integrations → Suite Modules, and **every optional module's pages are wrapped in `<ModuleGate>`** so a disabled module is locked by direct URL too, not just hidden from the nav. The frontend runs **live-only** against public data providers via its `/live-data/*` route handlers. User data (portfolios, watchlists, builder plans, wallets) persists to Postgres through `/api/user/*`; module entitlements are **localStorage-only** (`useEntitlementStore` — the `entitlements` table exists in the schema but no route serves it yet, which is the Phase 6 rollout-posture question); an optional legacy Python backend still serves assets/market-data/alerts/risk-scores, but **not** auth — sign-in is Auth.js against the app's own `users` table. Surfaces with no free real-time source show an explicit "not available" notice — there is no mock/demo data path.

**Working directory:** the repo root is the `Finance-Now` monorepo (`frontend/`, `backend/`,
`mcp-server/`, `infrastructure/`, `docs/`); **the Next.js app and all its npm commands live in
`frontend/`**. (Older docs reference a local `Crypto-Stuff\frontend` checkout path — same app,
pre-monorepo naming.)

**Agent charters:** four maintenance agents are deployed, split along two boundaries
(full table: `docs/IMPROVEMENT-AGENT-SETUP.md`). By scope: `code-checker`
(`docs/agents/` — diff/PR review against the review invariants + the do-not-fix
registry of deliberate decisions) vs `code-auditor` (`.claude/agents/` — repo-wide
dated defect reports). By kind of status write, both approval-gated:
`checklist-steward` (`docs/agents/` — maintains existing ledger entries) vs
`opportunity-scout` FILE mode (`.claude/agents/` — inserts newly approved TASK-QUEUE
items). The two TASK-QUEUE writers must read each other's outputs before writing
(`docs/audits/rejected-proposals.md` ↔ steward annotations). If you are reviewing
code or updating status docs, read the matching charter first; each ends with a
ready-to-paste deployable prompt.

### Module boundary rules (keep these or the suite can't be split later)
1. A module's pages import shared code only from `components/ui`, `components/charts`, `components/markets`, `lib/` core, and its own folders — never another module's internals.
2. Cross-module data flows through `/live-data` or `/api/v1` routes, never direct page imports.
3. New module = new entry in `lib/modules/registry.ts` + pages wrapped in `<ModuleGate module="...">`.

## How Changes Land

**Branch and PR by default** (owner, 2026-08-22). Work goes on a feature branch
and lands through a draft pull request — not straight onto `main`.

The reason is review, not ceremony. A run of changes went directly to `main`
during P3-W3, including two that altered what ships in the initial rollout
(hiding Transfer Fees and Wallets). Those are exactly the changes that deserve a
diff someone can read before they land, and a commit message is not a substitute
for one: it explains what the author *meant*, not what the patch *does*.

Direct-to-`main` is for when the owner asks for it in the moment, and it stays
the exception.

**History and archives.** `main` was re-rooted on 2026-08-05: its root commit is a
full-tree snapshot of PR #71, and nothing before it — PRs #1–#70, ~354 commits back to
the 2026-05-24 scaffold — is reachable from `main`. That history is preserved on the
`archive/pre-reset*` branches (anchor: `archive/pre-reset-main`, 264 commits, plus 13
`archive/pre-reset/*` tips holding commits the anchor lacks; created 2026-08-24 — see
`docs/audits/git-repo-audit-2026-08-23.md`, PR #110). Any "recoverable from git history"
claim about a deletion made **before 2026-08-05** resolves there, not in `main`'s log —
`git log`, `--follow`, and blame all stop at the re-root unless those branches are
fetched. `archive/wave-two-pre-reset` is the same pattern for the wave-2 rollback of
2026-08-15. Keep every `archive/*` branch through any stale-branch cleanup.

**Standing rule:** any history-shaping operation — force-pushing or re-rooting a branch,
deleting branches, archiving a workstream — lands **together with a dated note in
`docs/`** saying what was done and where the prior state lives. A reset nobody writes
down silently breaks every recoverability claim written before it; the 2026-08-05
re-root went unrecorded for 19 days and did exactly that.

## Adding a New Page — Checklist

1. **Create the page:** `src/app/(dashboard)/your-page/page.tsx`
   - Add `'use client'` at top if it uses React hooks
   - Server components are fine for static content

2. **Add to sidebar:** `src/lib/modules/registry.ts` (NOT Sidebar.tsx — it renders from the registry)
   - Import the icon from `lucide-react`
   - Add entry to the owning module's `navItems`: `{ href: '/your-page', label: 'Label', icon: IconName }`
   - To nest it under an existing entry, add it to that entry's `children` array instead
     (**one level only**; the parent must still route somewhere, since its label is a link).
     `lib/modules/__tests__/registry.test.ts` fails on a nav href with no `page.tsx`, a
     duplicate href, or a third level of nesting
   - If the page belongs to an optional module, also add its route prefix to that module's `routePrefixes` and wrap the page in `<ModuleGate module="...">`
   - **Wrap at the component boundary, not inside the page's JSX.** `export default function Page() { return <ModuleGate module="x"><PageInner /></ModuleGate> }` — so a disabled module never mounts `PageInner` and its queries never fire. Wrapping the returned JSX instead renders the lock notice while still fetching everything behind it

3. **If you need a live data API route:** `src/app/live-data/your-route/route.ts`
   - **If it fetches a host the app doesn't already use, read that site's terms first** and
     add an entry to `lib/server/sourceTerms.ts` + `lib/data/dataSources.ts`. The test suite
     fails on an unregistered host — see "Source Terms" below
   - Always add `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` (prevents static caching)
   - Use `next: { revalidate: N }` on individual `fetch()` calls (N in seconds)
   - Return `NextResponse.json(...)` with a typed interface exported from the route
   - Every multi-fetch needs a **failure boundary that preserves partial results** — never let one upstream
     failure crash the route. `Promise.allSettled` when the fetches are genuinely independent; per-leg
     try/catch when they are a sequential fallback ladder (see the pattern note below — parallelising a
     ladder is a regression, not a fix)

4. **If you need static data:** `src/lib/data/your-data.ts`
   - Export typed interfaces, constants, and helper functions
   - No API calls in this layer — pure data

All external API calls happen in **server-side route handlers** (`/live-data/*`), never from client components. This keeps API keys off the client and lets Next.js cache responses. Every host also has to clear the **source-terms registry** before it is fetched — see "Source Terms" below.

```
Client component
  → useQuery('/live-data/foo')         # React Query, runs in browser
    → src/app/live-data/foo/route.ts   # Next.js route handler, runs on server
      → External APIs (CoinGecko, mempool.space, Lido, etc.)
```

### Key external APIs used (no auth keys required):
| API | Used for | Route |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price` | Coin prices (16 coins) | `network-fees`, `staking-rates` |
| `mempool.space/api/v1/fees/recommended` | Live BTC sat/vByte fee | `network-fees` |
| `eth-api.lido.fi/v1/protocol/steth/apr/sma` | Live stETH APR | `staking-rates` |
| `api.marinade.finance/msol/apy/1y` | Live mSOL APY | `staking-rates` |
| `kobe.mainnet.jito.network/api/v1/apy` | Live jitoSOL APY | `staking-rates` |
| Various RSS/JSON feeds | News articles | `news` |

### React Query patterns on the client:
```typescript
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['unique-key'],
  queryFn: () => fetch('/live-data/your-route').then(r => r.json()),
  staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5,       // don't refetch for 5 minutes
  refetchInterval: 1000 * 60 * 10, // background refresh every 10 minutes
})
```

## Data Files Reference

> **Every hand-maintained table must carry provenance.** Curated reference data
> presented next to live data reads as live, and three separate audit findings
> (H2, M5, L2) were the same bug: a static snapshot shown with no age, or worse,
> stamped with a fresh `updatedAt`. The established pattern — copy it — is a
> `*_LAST_VERIFIED` date, a `*_STALE_AFTER_DAYS` window, `…AgeDays(now)` /
> `…IsStale(now)` with an **injectable `now`** so it's testable, and a
> `get…Provenance()` returning `{ source, verifiedAt, ageDays, stale, confidence }`.
> Render it with `<ProvenanceNotice>` (components/ui) — **always visible, not only
> when stale**, since a notice that only appears past a threshold teaches readers
> to treat its absence as "live". Reference implementations: `transferFees.ts`,
> `stablecoinMeta.ts`, `stakingProviders.ts`.
>
> Date the table by when it was **compiled as a whole**, never by its most recent
> partial edit — re-verifying 8 rows of 55 does not refresh the other 47.

### `src/lib/data/transferFees.ts`
Central data file for the Transfer Fee Calculator.

- **`CoinId`** union — 22 coins: btc, eth, usdt, usdc, bnb, sol, dai, xrp, ltc, trx, doge, matic, avax, ada, dot, atom, link, ton, shib, uni, near, arb
- **`NetworkId`** union — 18 networks: erc20, trc20, bep20, solana, polygon, arbitrum, base, optimism, avalanche, bitcoin, xrpl, litecoin, dogecoin, cardano, polkadot, cosmos, ton_network, near_network
- **`EXCHANGES`** array — 30 exchanges (Binance through Hyperliquid), each with per-coin/per-network `withdrawFee`, `minWithdraw`, `withdrawEnabled`, `depositEnabled`, optional `note`. Data is hand-maintained with provenance: `TRANSFER_FEES_LAST_VERIFIED` + `getTransferFeeProvenance()` drive a staleness banner (stale after 120 days).
- **`findTransferPaths()`** — path-finding algorithm: direct routes first, then multi-hop via personal wallet, sorted by totalFeeUsd
- **`PERSONAL_WALLET_ID = 'wallet'`** — the "My Wallet" option in the From/To selectors
- **`EVM_NETWORKS`** — array of all EVM-compatible network IDs (address collision danger)

To add an exchange: append to `EXCHANGES` array following the existing pattern. Tier 1 = major/regulated, Tier 2 = smaller.

### `src/lib/data/stakingProviders.ts`
Central data file for the Staking Opportunities page.

- **Provenance:** `STAKING_DATA_LAST_VERIFIED` + `getStakingDataProvenance()` drive the freshness notice on `/staking` (both the Providers and Live Pools tabs — `/staking-discovery` was merged in on 2026-08-20 and now redirects), and the `referenceData` block on `/api/v1/staking/opportunities`. Stale after 90 days (shorter than the 120 used for fees/attestations — a provider's risk profile can change overnight, which is why Celsius is in the catalog).
- **`StakingCoinId`** — 16 stakeable coins: eth, sol, ada, dot, atom, matic, avax, bnb, trx, btc, cro, osmo, ksm, inj, tia, near
- **`ProviderCategory`** — `'cefi' | 'wallet' | 'liquid'`
- **`RiskProfile`** — 6 dimensions, each 1–10: `custodyRisk`, `counterpartyRisk`, `contractRisk`, `slashingRisk`, `liquidityRisk`, `regulatoryRisk`
- **`computeOverallRisk(risks)` and `getRiskLevel(score)` are `@internal` legacy helpers — do not reach for them in new code.** They run a **1–10, higher-is-RISKIER** scale (weights: counterparty 25%, custody 20%, liquidity 20%, contract 15%, slashing 10%, regulatory 10%) with a 4-level band whose `medium` does not exist in the canonical vocabulary at all. They are kept for exactly one reason: the public `/api/v1/staking/opportunities` contract still serves those fields (R2 §5.3). There is deliberately **no deprecation date** (P4, 2026-07-19) — removing them is an API break, not a cleanup.
  **New code scores staking through `scoreStakingProvider()`** (`lib/risk/profiles/stakingAdapter.ts`), which wraps the same weights and converts at the boundary to the canonical **0–100, higher-is-SAFER** score with the 5-band vocabulary (low/moderate/elevated/high/critical). Two scales pointing opposite ways is precisely the collision the risk-scale spec exists to prevent, so read the direction before you read the number.
- **`STAKING_PROVIDERS`** array — 55 providers (count is dynamic; the page reads `STAKING_PROVIDERS.length`). Representative names:
  - CeFi: Celsius (defunct, cautionary), Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, OKX, Bybit, KuCoin, Crypto.com, Bitget, Gate.io, HTX, Robinhood, Nexo, Gemini, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, MEXC, Upbit
  - Wallet: Ledger Live, MetaMask, Phantom, Trust Wallet, Exodus, Keplr, Solflare, Coinbase Wallet, Atomic Wallet, Trezor Suite
  - Liquid/restaking: Lido, Rocket Pool, Marinade, Jito, Stride, Benqi, EtherFi, Frax, Stakewise, Stader, Swell, Renzo, Kelp, Puffer, Bedrock, Sanctum, Babylon, Lombard, Aave, Convex, Ankr, MetaPool, and more

To add a provider: append to `STAKING_PROVIDERS` following the pattern. Celsius should always be kept — it's used as the educational cautionary example.

### `src/lib/data/equityCatalog.ts` (Equities module)
- **`EQUITY_CATALOG`** — 79 large-cap US stocks with sector (11 GICS sectors in `SECTOR_INFO`), industry, and approximate reference values (price, market cap, P/E, dividend yield, beta). Reference values are fallbacks — live quotes override price/change.
- Symbols use the dash form of the class-share convention (`BRK-B`, not `BRK.B`) — every provider in the quote ladder accepts it, so one string works across all of them.
- To add a stock: append to `EQUITY_CATALOG`; the registry table, detail route, and quote universe pick it up automatically.

### `src/lib/data/fundCatalog.ts` (Funds module)
- **`FUND_CATALOG`** — 126 funds (`type: 'etf' | 'mutual'`) with issuer, category (`FUND_CATEGORY_INFO`), expense ratio, AUM, yield, inception, tracked index, and indicative top holdings.
- **`computeFeeDrag(principal, erPct, years, returnPct, benchmarkErPct, frontLoadPct)`** — cost projection used by the Fee Drag Analyzer on fund detail pages. `frontLoadPct` is a SALES CHARGE deducted at purchase, not an annual fee: it comes off the top so only the remainder compounds, and it is **not** charged to the benchmark (a no-load index fund), or the comparison would cancel out the very difference it exists to show. Defaults to 0, so every no-load fund is unaffected.
- **`SalesCharge` / `fundSalesCharge(f)`** — a fund's load, or null. **`kind` is required and `maxPct` is optional on purpose**: a load's EXISTENCE (from the issuer's documented share-class structure) and its RATE (from the prospectus) are separately knowable, and conflating them is how a wrong fee gets published. Undefined `maxPct` means *"a charge applies and we have not verified how much"* — never *"no charge"*. A stated rate REQUIRES `source` + `verifiedAt`, enforced catalog-wide by a test. The UI puts a verified rate into the maths and discloses an unverified one in words while excluding it from the projection: guessing is worse than omitting, and omitting silently is worse than both. Populate rates with `npm run fund-fees` (below), never from memory.
- To add a fund: append to `FUND_CATALOG` following the pattern.

### `src/lib/data/portfolioBuilder.ts` (Portfolio Builder module)
Pure engine, no API calls, covered by `__tests__/portfolioBuilder.test.ts` (86 tests).

- **`buildPortfolio(inputs)`** — questionnaire → `BuiltPortfolio`. The glide path anchors to `yearsToFirstUse` (the spend date), **not** retirement; risk tolerance shifts it ±15pts but can never extend a horizon.
- **Sleeve appetite + style.** Appetite decides *how much* (`commodityComfort` / `currencyComfort`, `SleeveAppetite = none|small|moderate`); **style decides *what kind*** (`cryptoStyle` / `commodityStyle` / `currencyStyle` / `bondStyle`) because risk varies as much inside an asset class as between them. Style tables (`CRYPTO_STYLES`, `COMMODITY_STYLES`, `CURRENCY_STYLES`, `BOND_STYLES`) each carry a `label`, a plain-language risk `note` shown in the UI at the point of choice, and (except bonds) an instrument `mix`. Bonds have style but no appetite — they're always held; `applyBondStyle()` rewrites the duration ladder for credit posture (treasury swaps BND→IEF; corporate/high-yield scale the ladder and append LQD/HYG). Higher-risk styles emit explicit notes (high-yield behaves like equity in a crisis; commodity currencies fall *with* equities; silver is ~2× gold's volatility). **All style fields are optional and every default reproduces pre-style behaviour**, so saved plans replay unchanged.
- **Sleeve legs use `MIN_SLEEVE_LEG_PCT` (2%), not the bond ladder's `MIN_RUNG_PCT` (1%)** — a sleeve leg is a distinct position to buy and rebalance, not a duration slice. When a sleeve is too small to carry its style's legs it collapses to the largest one **and says so in a note**, rather than silently ignoring the user's choice. Both fields are **optional (`?`) on purpose** — plans saved before they existed replay through `reviewPlan()`'s aged rebuild and must rebuild identically, so absent === `'none'`. Commodities: GLDM alone at small, GLDM+PDBC (K-1-free basket) at moderate; **deliberately not scaled by risk tolerance** — gold is a diversifier, and an aggressive investor may rationally want none. Currency: FXE at small, FXE+FXY at moderate, and **always** emits a warn note that foreign cash has no long-run expected return and that VXUS already carries unhedged FX exposure.
- **Each sleeve is funded from its own side of the growth/defensive split** so opting in never changes how much risk the plan takes: commodities come out of equity (they're growth-side, and are counted in `GROWTH_CLASSES` for risk-drift), currency comes out of the bond residual (it moves like cash). Verified by test: growth/defensive totals are unchanged with sleeves on.
- **`bondLadder(horizon)` / `consolidateLadder(rungs, sleevePct)`** — duration matched to the spend date (SHY → IEF → BND → TLT). `consolidateLadder` drops rungs worth under `MIN_RUNG_PCT` (1%) and re-spreads them, so a thin sleeve becomes one real position instead of several unbuyable slivers.
- **Sector exclusions remove tilts only.** A broad-market core still holds the excluded companies at index weight, and the engine says so in a note — the catalog carries no screened fund, so a true screen is not deliverable. Do not "fix" this by silently dropping the core.
- **`fees`** — blended expense ratio, annual dollar cost, and compounded drag vs a 3bps benchmark. There is deliberately **no** fee warning at build time: every reachable instrument is a cheap index fund, so the blend tops out near 0.13% and any threshold would be dead code.
- **`diversificationScore`** — Gini–Simpson diversity (1 − Σwᵢ²) over the class mix, worth 90 points, plus up to 10 graded points for international equity reaching 20% of the plan. Replaced (2026-07-21) a count-based formula that pinned every reasonable multi-class plan at exactly 100. Realistic range is ~48–75; the ceiling is unreachable by an actual plan, on purpose — don't "fix" a plan not scoring 100.
- **`checkDrift(plan, weights, valueUsd)`** — target vs actual with per-holding buy/sell dollar trades, turnover, and off-plan positions. Drift exactly on the band is `hold`; only a breach trades.
- **`reviewPlan(saved, actual?, now?)`** — suitability monitoring: ageing glide path, risk drift, fee creep, concentration, off-plan holdings, overdue review. Checks needing real holdings are skipped rather than guessed when `actual` is absent. `now` is injectable so time-dependent behaviour is testable. **Fee creep is checked here**, against what the user actually holds (which can include 0.49–0.87% funds), not at build time.
- **Concentration is measured against the plan's own target**, not an absolute weight — a 55% total-market core is 3,500 companies held on purpose, and flagging it would train users to ignore the warning.
- **`actualWeightsFromPortfolio(portfolio, prices)`** — bridges a `/portfolios` portfolio into symbol→weight. Positions with no live price are **excluded, never valued at cost**; `pricedPct` reports coverage so the UI can disclose it.
- UI: `src/components/portfolio-builder/PlanMonitor.tsx` (expandable per saved plan) supports both a linked portfolio and manual weight entry.
- **Plans persist to Postgres** (`builder_plans` table — jsonb snapshot of engine output, deliberately not normalized) via `/api/user/builder-plans` (+ `/[id]` PATCH/DELETE). Ownership via `getCurrentUserId()` (local-user mode while the auth wall is off). The page one-time-imports legacy `BUILDER_STORAGE_KEY` localStorage plans (timestamps preserved, key renamed `*:imported` so it can't run twice). `builder_plans.linked_portfolio_id` persists which portfolio the drift monitor compares against (auto-selected on load; portfolios are DB-backed with UUID ids).
- **⚠ New API routes with dynamic segments MUST live under `/api/user/`** — the `next.config.mjs` rewrite proxies other `/api/*` paths to the legacy backend, and dynamic routes lose to rewrites (see comment in next.config.mjs).

### Quote plumbing for both modules (`src/lib/api/live/marketData.ts`)
**All four equity data surfaces are registry-driven** (same provider system as crypto — `src/lib/api/live/providers.ts`, configured on the Integrations page, persisted to `.provider-config.json`; providers carry `market: 'crypto' | 'equities'` so the two sides never cross). Every surface records per-provider utilization, supports toggling built-ins (order is fixed by the registry — there is no reorder action), and accepts user-added custom feeds (SSRF-validated, auth via header/query/bearer, tolerant JSON field extraction in `src/lib/server/customFeeds.ts`):

- **Quotes** (`fetchSecurityQuotes` → `getEquityQuoteProviders()`): custom `json-quote` feeds first, then FMP → Finnhub → Twelve Data → Tiingo → Alpha Vantage → catalog reference prices. **Every live rung is keyed** since the Yahoo removal (2026-08-06) — see below. `{symbol}` (per-symbol) or `{symbols}` (batch) placeholders. **Stooq used to be the last live rung and is gone** — it 404s on every variant (confirmed in the 2026-07-19 audit) and has been removed from the registry and the quote path; catalog reference is the real last resort. The only remnant is the legacy `'stooq'` value in `PRICE_SOURCES` (db/schema/instruments.ts), which is inert. Don't re-add it as a fallback.
- **News** (`/live-data/market-news` → `getEquityProviders('news')`): built-ins MarketWatch / CNBC plus custom `rss`/`atom`/`json-news` feeds, all active sources merged in parallel. **There is no per-ticker feed** — Yahoo's was the only free one. Symbol mode reads the same general wires and filters to articles that actually name the company, and does **not** force-tag the requested symbol onto unrelated stories.
- **Social** (`/live-data/stock-social` → `getEquityProviders('social')`): built-ins Reddit Finance / StockTwits plus custom `json-social` feeds. (Reddit 403s from datacenter IPs without OAuth — expect StockTwits-only in server/CI environments.)
- **OHLCV / TA / backtests** (`/live-data/security-ohlcv` → `getEquityOhlcvProviders()`): custom `json-ohlcv` feeds first, then Tiingo → FMP. Both keyed; with neither the route reports `source: 'none'` and the TA/backtest/candlestick surfaces show their no-live-source state.

UI labels non-live prices with a small amber `ref` tag; KPIs needing live data show "requires live quotes" instead of fabricated values.

The **TopBar data-tier dropdown** (`TierSwitch` / `src/lib/tier.ts`) breaks sourcing down per category. Categories carry a `market: 'crypto' | 'equities'` field: crypto rows respond to the free/paid/custom toggle as before; equity rows are `informational: true` — they reflect the live registry (enabled providers per category, scoped by market) rather than the toggle, since equity sourcing is managed entirely on the Integrations page. Multi-select option lists are market-scoped so crypto selectors never pull in equity providers that share a `category` id.

## Source Terms — may we use this website?

**Before any host is fetched, there is a dated verdict on what its terms of use permit.**
`src/lib/server/sourceTerms.ts` is the registry; `termsProbe.ts` is the live check for a
site nobody has reviewed. Full design: `docs/architecture/source-terms.md`.

> ⚠ **Yahoo Finance was removed as a data source on 2026-08-06 — on terms grounds, not
> availability.** The `query1/query2.finance.yahoo.com` v8/v10 endpoints are undocumented
> internals of Yahoo's own web app with no published third-party API terms, while Yahoo's
> ToS prohibit automated access and redistribution. It is **hard-blocked in code**:
> `pinnedFetch` refuses `*.yahoo.com` at the socket, so re-adding a fetcher does not bring
> it back. **Do not reintroduce it** without changing the registry verdict, which means
> re-reading the terms and being able to defend the change.
>
> It was the only **keyless** rung on the equity/fund/macro quote, chart and OHLCV paths.
> What that cost, all of it deliberate and visible rather than papered over:
>
> | Surface | Now |
> |---|---|
> | Quotes, charts, OHLCV/TA/backtests (stocks, funds, macro) | **Key-gated.** FMP/Finnhub/Twelve Data/Tiingo/Alpha Vantage for quotes, Tiingo→FMP for history. No key ⇒ catalog `ref` prices for stocks/funds, an honest dash for macro |
> | **Macro instrument quotes** (`GC=F`, `EURUSD=X`) | **Hit hardest.** Tiingo does not carry them, so coverage depends on the keyed provider configured and is expected to be partial |
> | **Treasury yield indices** (`^IRX`/`^FVX`/`^TNX`/`^TYX`) | **No longer affected (2026-09-03, D3).** No free provider quotes them at all — FMP paywalls them, Finnhub returns nothing, Twelve Data 404s, Alpha Vantage answers empty — so they were moved off the quote ladder onto the official treasury.gov par curve: keyless, plain percent, daily |
> | **Futures term structure** (`/live-data/futures-curve`) | **No source at all.** Nothing reachable quotes a dated contract month. The route resolves the months and returns `ok:false` with the reason; `TermStructureCard` prints it. Front-month prices are unaffected |
> | Trailing returns | One request per symbol. `?universe=` is **refused**, not truncated; `?symbols=` capped at 60. Fund return **screening and sorting are off** — a screen that could only see the visible page would filter as though it had seen every fund. Per-page Returns columns still live |
> | Per-ticker news | **Gone.** Symbol mode reads the general wires and keeps articles that name the company. It no longer force-tags the requested symbol onto unrelated stories |
> | Fund holdings | Unaffected (SEC N-PORT, keyless). Sector weights now need an FMP key (N-PORT carries no GICS classification). The stock/bond/cash **asset mix is derived from N-PORT's `assetCat`** (NT9, `lib/utils/assetMix.ts`) — keyless, so also unaffected; the earlier "no source" note here was overtaken by that work. It is absent only for filers that publish no N-PORT (UITs such as SPY), where the section correctly does not render |
> | FX converter, Treasury curve, SEC filings/XBRL, all of crypto | **Unaffected** — keyless and unrelated |

>   "non-commercial" alarm the probe raised never applied here. Clause 4.4
>   prescribes the attribution **message**, so `SourceProvider.attribution`
>   carries "Powered by CoinGecko" verbatim with a 10px floor and `SourceLine`
>   renders it — a test parses the rendered class and fails below the floor.
> - **Reddit's robots.txt disallows this app's agent**, so reddit.com is gated
>   off unless `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` is set, enforced in `pinnedFetch` so a new

**To close it:** `npm run terms:report -- --seeded` (or `--news`) from a machine
> that can reach these sites writes a review worksheet — current verdict, what the
> probe saw, a link to the document, and a conclusion box per host. Read the
> documents, then flip `review` to `'verified'`. The open queue for the news
> publishers is `docs/audits/terms-review-news-2026-08-07.md`. **The news feeds are

> permission rests on a publisher syndication policy rather than an API licence.

**Three verdicts**, because two would collapse a real distinction:
- `approved` — permitted, unconditionally enough to just use it.
- `conditional` — permitted *while conditions hold* (attribution, a rate limit, "headline
  and link only", "personal use"). Most of the registry. The conditions are the
  maintainer's obligation, not something code enforces; writing them down is the point.
- `prohibited` — hard-blocked, no override, anywhere.

**Two assertion forms, and the split is the design:**
- `assertSourceNotProhibited` (used by `pinnedFetch`) — only `prohibited` fails. A
  decision about *someone else's terms*, so it binds every request forever.
- `assertSourceAllowed` (strict) — an unreviewed host fails too. A decision about *us*,
  enforced at test time and at save time, where a human can be asked.

Collapsing them would either let a prohibited host through or make the acknowledgement
flow a lie.

**Enforcement, by path:**
- **Built-ins → test time.** `__tests__/sourceTerms.test.ts` walks every `host` in
  `lib/data/dataSources.ts` and fails if one is unregistered or prohibited. Add a route
  fetching a new host and the suite fails until someone reads that site's terms. (It
  caught ten already-shipping hosts with no review on its first run.)
- **User-added feeds → save time, then socket.** `/live-data/config` runs
  `probeSiteTerms()` on `add-custom` **and** `update-custom` (or "add an approved feed,
  then edit the URL" is a hole straight through the gate). A hard block is `403` with no
  override; anything else needing a human is `409` carrying the report, and the
  Integrations UI shows the matched clauses and asks for `termsAcknowledged`.

**Two review states**, and the split is not cosmetic:
- `verified` — someone opened the document and read the relevant clauses on `reviewedAt`.
- `seeded` — written from documented posture, never read. The first cut of this file
  had no such field, so 47 unread entries all carried a date that read as "checked".
  A verdict nobody read, wearing a date saying somebody did, launders an assumption
  into a record — which is worse than having no registry.

**Two rules the probe follows, and you should too:**
1. **A keyword scan is not a reading.** Only `blocked` is enforced automatically;
   "nothing prohibitive found" still asks a human.
2. **"Couldn't read it" is not permission.** Publishers 403 datacenter IPs, including on
   their legal pages. `unknown` asks a human, exactly like `needs-review`. Same rule as
   the data audits: verify on the owner's machine, never downgrade a verdict on a CI probe.

Verdicts go **stale** (180 days) rather than expiring — terms change, but breaking the app
because nobody re-read a document is the wrong failure. The registry is dated by its
**oldest** entry, not its newest, exactly like the hand-maintained data catalogs.

Finance Now runs **live-only**. `LIVE_DATA` is hardcoded `true` in `lib/constants.ts` — there is **no** `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_DATA` toggle and **no mock data path**. All market data comes from the `/live-data/*` route handlers; surfaces with no free real-time source show an explicit "not available" notice rather than fabricated values. See `DATA-AVAILABILITY.md`.

## Testing the Live Data Layer

```bash
npm run smoke   # quick subset (CI)
npm run audit   # full audit; also audit:strict and audit:json
```

**Fee reconciliation (owner machine — needs sec.gov):**

```bash
npm run fund-fees -- --inspect   # discover the dataset's tables/columns/tags; changes nothing
npm run fund-fees                # write fund-fee-reconcile.json + fund-fee-worksheet.csv
```

`scripts/build-fund-fees.mjs` checks `FUND_CATALOG`'s expense ratios and finds its sales-load
rates against the SEC's quarterly **Risk/Return Summary** data sets — the prospectus fee table as
structured XBRL. It fills the gap `build-fund-facts.mjs` names: N-PORT carries no expense tag.

It **reports, never writes** — same split as `apply-fee-updates.ts`, because an automated fee
overwrite is how a correct number lands on the wrong fund, and share classes make that easy
(AGTHX/AGTFX/CGFAX). Matching is on ticker, never a name or a number, and it never moves
`FUND_DATA_LAST_VERIFIED`. **Run `--inspect` first**: the tag and column names are candidates until
someone confirms them against a real archive.

⚠ The decimal-vs-percent unit is **calibrated once against the catalog**, not guessed per value —
expense-ratio ranges overlap between the two encodings (`0.03` is either 3% or 0.03%, and 0.03% is
VOO), so a per-value rule produces a silent 100× error on the cheapest funds. An undecidable unit
aborts the run.

Both run `scripts/test-live-data.mjs` (the old `scripts/smoke.mjs` was folded into it —
`smoke` is now just `--quick`).

⚠ **The harness throttles its own CoinGecko calls, and the pacing is WEIGHTED per
check** (`scripts/lib/coingeckoPacing.mjs`, pure + tested with an injectable
clock). Two earlier models each looked right and weren't, and the symptom both
times was a healthy route reported as broken: first *adjacency* (pause only after
another CoinGecko check — backwards, a rate limit is a rate over a window), then
*one check = one call* — which fixed `alerts` and `portfolio-history` but not
`coin-discovery`, because `coin-list` issues **three** upstream page requests
inside a single check and the budget recorded one. The next check took the 429 that
belonged to its neighbour. Weights **mirror the routes** (`coin-list` = 3 pages);
keep them in step or the budget drifts back out. The weight is an upper bound on
purpose — a ladder check like `ohlcv` may be served by Binance and spend no budget
at all, and over-counting costs seconds while under-counting costs a 429 that reads
as a broken route. The run prints what the pacing cost, so the delay is never
mistaken for slowness and "optimised" back out.

**REAL vs FALLBACK** classification rather than the HTTP status: a 200 carrying fallback data
is the failure mode that misdirects debugging to the UI layer. An earlier harness reported
43/43 PASS while several routes were quietly serving static catalogs.

This matters when judging AI agent output too — agent tools read the same `/live-data/*` routes
the UI does, so an agent giving vague answers off a FALLBACK route is a data problem, not a
prompt problem. Don't tune a prompt to compensate for a degraded feed.

**Staking upstream triage (owner machine):**

```bash
npm run staking-upstreams          # probe the route's 7 upstreams directly; no dev server
npm run staking-upstreams -- --json
```

`scripts/probe-staking-upstreams.mjs` asks each of `/live-data/staking-rates`'s
upstreams the same question the route asks, **outside** the route, and groups the
answers by the cure — because the cures are mutually exclusive and the route
cannot tell them apart:

| Verdict | Cure |
|---|---|
| `no-rate` / `partial` | endpoint answered, but no usable number — **read the body excerpt the probe prints**, because two opposite cures land here. Either the field MOVED (reparse, keep the URL) or the endpoint carries no rate AT ALL (drop the rung). NEAR was the second: `api.nearblocks.io/v1/stats` is a healthy network-stats endpoint with no yield field in it, and this row used to assert "the field moved", which sent the reader hunting for something never there |
| `http-error` / `unreachable` | endpoint gone — find the new URL or drop the rung |
| `over-budget` | served a usable rate, just slower than the route's 6s — raise the budget, nothing to reparse |
| `timeout` | in the default SEQUENTIAL mode, that host really is slow; under `--parallel` it means nothing about the host |
| `blocked-here` | **our own egress policy refused it** — says nothing about the source |

**It probes SEQUENTIALLY by default, and that is load-bearing.** The route fires every
upstream at once under a *shared* 6s clock, and the 2026-09-09 audit showed the cost:
upstreams 1–5 answered and 6–17 "timed out", **in array order** — position decided
the outcome, so that was queueing, not host health. The sequential run then found
*why*: **four dead hosts whose DNS lookups hung ~10s each**, occupying Node's
4-thread resolver pool for longer than the whole budget. Removing them (nine rungs
went in that pass; NEAR made ten across the audit) was the fix — no healthy source was ever slower than 1.3s. The probe's first version fanned
out the same way and would have reported twelve healthy hosts as dead. `--parallel`
reproduces the route deliberately; the difference between the two runs is the
measurement of contention, and parallel mode names the array-order signature when it
sees it.

The `blocked-here` verdict is the same principle: a sandboxed run 403s on every host,
and reporting that as "endpoint gone" would be this probe committing the
misattribution it exists to catch. When half or more of the hosts are blocked locally the probe prints
"THIS RUN PROVES NOTHING ABOUT THE SOURCES" and exits **2** (inconclusive) rather
than 1 (sources broken) — a caller must be able to tell "the sources are down"
from "you ran this in the wrong place".

`lib/server/__tests__/stakingUpstreamProbe.test.ts` fails if the probe's URL list,
upstream names, or timeout drift from the route's — a mirror is only useful while
it matches, and a stale one looks authoritative while pointing at a source the app
no longer uses.

**DeFiLlama symbol resolution (owner machine):**

```bash
npm run llama-symbols              # which LLAMA_MAP keys no longer match a pool, and what does
npm run llama-symbols -- --json
```

`staking-rates` reports `defillama-yields: partial (19/25 live)` and names the
misses. Naming them is what made them fixable — but it stops one step short: that
`STKBNB` matched nothing does not say whether the **token was renamed**, the
**pool was delisted**, or the **chain label moved**, and those have three
different cures. `scripts/probe-llama-symbols.mjs` fetches the pool list once and,
per unmatched key, prints what DeFiLlama actually carries through three lenses —
same project staking that asset, same project any asset, similar symbol any
project. Nothing from that project at all means the rung is gone and should follow
the NEAR one out, on the same evidence standard.

It **reports, never writes** (same split as the fee scripts — an automated symbol
rewrite is how a rate from the wrong protocol lands on a coin), reproduces the
route's matcher exactly including the chain preference, and exits **2** rather
than 1 when DeFiLlama is unreachable — "you ran this in the wrong place" is not
"the symbols are wrong". `lib/server/__tests__/llamaSymbolProbe.test.ts` fails if
the probe's map drifts from the route's.

**⚠ Data-availability results are IP-dependent — audits MUST run on the owner's machine.**
LunarCrush blocks datacenter IPs and the cloud gateway blocks most provider hosts outright, so a
cloud or CI run produces a systematically wrong baseline of "which sources work." Code reading,
design, and spec work are fine remotely; "which data sources actually work" is not.

Two caveats that are **not** cloud artifacts, so an owner-machine run does not clear them
(2026-09-09, `docs/audits/live-data-audit-2026-09-09.md`): **Binance.com's 451** is a US
geo-block, so for a US owner the Binance.US fallback is the steady state, not a degraded run;
and **Reddit's absence is our own robots gate**, not a rate limit — it lifts only with
`REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`. Both were previously filed under "datacenter IP", which sent debugging
after a network fault that was never there.

## Stale Time Constants (from `src/lib/constants.ts`)

```typescript
STALE_TIME_SHORT  = 30_000   // 30s  — prices, volatile data
STALE_TIME_MEDIUM = 60_000   // 1m   — news, social
STALE_TIME_LONG   = 300_000  // 5m   — fees, staking rates
GC_TIME           = 600_000  // 10m  — query cache retention
```

## Styling Conventions

Tailwind with custom CSS variables defined in `globals.css`:
- `bg-bg-card`, `bg-bg-elevated`, `bg-sidebar-gradient` — surface colors
- `text-text-primary`, `text-text-secondary`, `text-text-muted` — text hierarchy
- `border-border`, `border-border-hover` — border colors
- `text-accent-blue`, `bg-accent-blue` — primary accent (#3b82f6)
- `w-sidebar` — sidebar width constant

Risk/status color convention used across the app:
- **Emerald** (`emerald-400`) — low risk, positive, safe
- **Amber** (`amber-400`) — medium risk, warning
- **Orange** (`orange-400`) — high risk
- **Red** (`red-400/500`) — critical risk, danger, defunct

## Feature Inventory (what exists)

> **Data-status source of truth:** `DATA-AVAILABILITY.md` (repo root) is the authoritative,
> regularly-regenerated record of what is 🟢 Live / 🟡 Partial / 🔴 Not available. Consult it,
> not this table, when in doubt. Finance Now is live-only — there is **no mock/demo data path**;
> "Mock" labels in older docs are obsolete.

| Feature | Route | Status | Source / Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Headlines | `/headlines` | 🟢 Live | **Landing page** (`/` and post-login redirect here). Client-side merge of `/live-data/news` (crypto) + `/live-data/market-news` (equities) into a cross-module "Top Stories" strip plus a section per enabled module. Sections follow the entitlement store, so the feed reflects the user's bundle. Funds has no general feed of its own and shares the Markets section. Replaced the old `/dashboard` page; its `components/dashboard/*` widgets are retained but no longer routed. `RiskHeatmap` — the last one still reachable, via `PopoutContent` — was deleted on 2026-08-18 (item 4: a grid ranking every coin by risk band is a leaderboard in another shape). |
| Coins (Coin Registry) | `/assets` | 🟢 Live | Nav label "Coins"; route path kept as `/assets` to preserve deep links. Market-breadth KPIs, asset-type chips + inline screener, sortable/paginated table (Stock-Registry-standard layout), Reserve Monitor tab. **No Safety Score / Risk Band columns and no score screener** — removed 2026-08-18 (item 4); a sortable score column over the universe is a leaderboard. **No per-coin risk score is published anywhere as of 2026-08-29 (RP-6)** — owner: a risk figure on an asset the reader is viewing may be seen as a recommendation, a regulated activity. Removed: the header Safety Score gauge, the identity band pill, the search-result score, the Composite Risk panel, `/live-data/risk-scores`, `lib/api/live/riskScores.ts`, `useRiskScoreIndex`, `RiskScoreBadge`, and the `Asset.riskScore` / `riskBand` fields themselves (permanently-null fields invite a future "N/A" that reads as missing rather than withheld). **`lib/risk/` stays** — the options Trade Risk Scorer, staking-provider risk and the macro/equity profiles are separate decisions and remain live. Guarded by `lib/risk/__tests__/riskScoringRemoved.test.ts`. Live prices; metadata from static `assetCatalog.ts` (reference data, not mock) |
| Coin Detail | `/assets/[id]` | 🟢 Live | Price, OHLCV chart, per-coin news |
| Risk Scores | ~~`/risk-scores`~~ | ⚪ Removed | **Page deleted 2026-08-18** (P3-W2 short-list item 4); `/risk-scores` redirects to `/headlines`. Owner: *"these scores may represent a recommendation, which is a regulated activity."* The line drawn was **ranking vs explanation** — a leaderboard over a universe goes, scoring a coin the reader opened stays. `/live-data/risk-scores` was retained at the time for the per-coin panel; **both were removed on 2026-08-29 (RP-6)** — see the Coins row. See `docs/audits/rejected-proposals.md` RP-3 and the review's Appendix E |
| Reserves | `/assets?tab=reserves` | 🟢 Live | Reserve Transparency Monitor — DefiLlama stablecoin supply + collateralization (`/live-data/reserves`). **A tab inside Coins, not a page.** The standalone `/reserves` page was folded in on 2026-07-29 (`/reserves` → `/assets?tab=reserves`, `next.config.mjs`); no separate nav entry. ⚠ **All reserve UI lives in `components/analytics/reserves.tsx` — do not re-inline it.** Three hand-maintained copies existed and only the orphaned page ever got the fixes, so the two surfaces users actually reach carried the bugs: peg-mechanism badges keyed on `_` while the feed sends `-` (8 of 9 coins unstyled), a KPI reading "Verified Attestations … by third-party auditor" for something nobody verifies, a header claiming the whole table was live when only supply is, and no provenance at all. `ReserveProvenance` is mandatory on any surface showing attester/date/collateralization — those come from the `stablecoinMeta` snapshot, not the live feed |
| Alerts | TopBar bell | 🟢 Live | `/live-data/alerts` — stablecoin depegs + major-asset 24h moves; surfaced in the TopBar bell (no standalone page) |
| Watchlist | `/watchlist` | 🟢 Live | Cross-module: coins, stocks, ETFs & funds, and macro instruments in named lists with live prices. **DB-backed** via `/api/user/watchlists` (+`/[id]` PUT/DELETE) through `useWatchlistStore` (optimistic, client-UUID ids, one-time localStorage import that MERGES even into a non-empty account — see store comment). Feed bias (`lib/watchlist/bias.ts`) and the Daily Brief read the store, not localStorage |
| News | `/news` | 🟢 Live | Multi-provider RSS/JSON; sentiment + asset detection |
| Social | `/social` | 🟡 Partial | `/live-data/social`. **Live:** Reddit post text/link/author/timestamp (Atom feeds, keyless but robots-gated — see below), and the social VOLUME figures from Santiment (`mentionsCount`) and LunarCrush (`social_volume_24h`, `galaxy_score`), both **key-gated**: with no key those signals are absent, not zero. **Derived:** every sentiment label. Reddit's is a keyword regex over the post text; LunarCrush's is a threshold on galaxy score (≥60 / ≤35) rather than the provider's own `sentiment` field; Santiment's is hardcoded `neutral`. The per-asset `sentimentScore` aggregates those derived labels, so it is derived twice over. **Neither live nor derived:** Reddit `score` is a literal 0 and `upvoteRatio` is never set — Atom carries no vote data, and both are sentinels the pages render only when present. Reddit itself is gated off in `pinnedFetch` unless `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` is set (its robots.txt disallows this app's agent, 2026-08-29 terms review). |
| Global | `/global-adoption` | ⚪ De-routed | Access removed (T5) pending a post-production rework — a mislabeled CBDC tracker on stale/duplicated static data with a fabricated live timestamp. Page + `/live-data/cbdc-data` route retained; `/global-adoption` redirects to `/headlines`. See `docs/assessments/T5-utility-triage.md`. |
| Transfer Fee Calc | ~~`/transfer-fees`~~ | ⚪ **Hidden from rollout** | Static fee table (`transferFees.ts`) + live token prices; staleness-labeled. **Live withdrawal-fee overlay** (`/live-data/withdraw-fees`, keyless KuCoin/HTX confirmed + 5 unprobed; RP-5 forbids keyed endpoints) — overlay-only, per-row `live` tags. **Withdrawal availability is disclosed as assumed, not checked**: live-reported suspensions render as blocked routes with attribution, and the notice is deliberately NOT gated on fee staleness. `depositEnabled` is the same assumption with no source — a known open gap. Tax-character panel (`lib/data/taxCharacter.ts`) states what kind of event each leg is, with no numbers |
| Staking | `/staking` | 🟡 Partial | **Two tabs since 2026-08-20 (W3-3):** Providers (curated catalog, live APR where available, defunct toggle) and Live Pools (on-chain opportunities via `/live-data/staking-discovery`). Curated catalog is staleness-labeled (`getStakingDataProvenance()`) |
| Staking Discovery | ~~`/staking-discovery`~~ | ⚪ Merged | **Merged into `/staking` 2026-08-20 (W3-3, option B)** — its curated directory duplicated the Staking page's provider cards; the live on-chain pool discovery became the **Live Pools tab** on `/staking` (`?tab=pools`, content-preserving redirect). The defunct-platform toggle (Celsius, the cautionary example) moved to the Providers tab. `/live-data/staking-discovery` unchanged |
| Coin Discovery | `/coin-discovery` | 🟢 Live | Scored candidate coins from live market data. **Coin links point at the project's own site, not CoinGecko (2026-08-29)**, and each card carries an on-demand "About this project" panel — description, category tags, official site and whitepaper — from `/live-data/coin-profile`, a **two-rung ladder**: (1) **CoinMarketCap** when `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` is set — keyed, licensed and genuinely bulk (`/v2/cryptocurrency/info`, 1 credit per 100 coins), with identity resolved by `lib/utils/coinIdentity.ts`, which matches on symbol + name + **market-cap agreement** and **declines rather than guesses** (a wrong match would attach another project's website to a coin); (2) **CoinGecko** `/coins/{id}` per coin, keyless — switchable off with `FN_ALLOW_KEYLESS_COIN_PROFILES=false`, after which an unresolved coin renders an honest blank with its reason instead of reaching for a free-tier source. A coin CMC can't identify is reported as unresolved *with the reason*, so "we couldn't tell which project this is" never looks like "this project published nothing". Descriptions are sanitized to plain text and sentence-truncated (`lib/utils/coinDescription.ts`, pure + 14 tests) — never rendered as HTML. CoinGecko stays linked and labelled as the data source, which its free-tier terms require. **Verdict vocabulary retired 2026-08-18** (item 5b): "Strong Add / Consider / Monitor / Too Speculative" told the reader what to *do* with a coin; the same four bands are now named after the composite score they report (`profileBand`: high / moderate / low / very-low). Thresholds unchanged. The store's saved-coin field was renamed with a defensive read so pre-rename localStorage entries survive |
| Technical Analysis | `/technical-analysis` | 🟢 Derived | Trend/S-R/patterns/backtest computed client-side from live OHLCV. **The scanner is no longer a tab here** — see below |
| Crypto Scanner | `/scanner` | 🟢 Derived | Items 6/7 (2026-08-19): one scanner per section, promoted to nav. Seven setup detectors, three timeframes, bounded-concurrency scan, auto-refresh (its source is keyless). A scanner sweeps a universe to find candidates; the TA page charts the one you picked. **Screener filters** (`lib/data/scannerFilters.ts`, pure + 12 tests): visible coin range, market cap, FDV, 24h volume and 24h change — applied BEFORE the sweep, so filtering cuts OHLCV requests rather than just shortening the table. CMC's Networks/Category/Exchange/Volume-change/Age filters are deliberately ABSENT with the reason shown on-page (no source for those fields; an inert control would imply a narrowing that never happened). Coins with no market data are counted as 'not tested', never folded into 'excluded' |
| Portfolios | `/portfolios` | 🟢 Live | Live prices + history (`/live-data/portfolio-*`). **DB-backed** via `/api/user/portfolios` (+`/[id]` PUT/DELETE): store keeps its sync Zustand interface via optimistic mutations + client-UUID ids; consumers call `hydratePortfolios()` on mount; one-time localStorage import. Holdings resolve through the instrument layer (`lib/server/instrumentResolve.ts` — global rows, cgId round-trips via `instrument_crypto.coingecko_id`). **All-asset-class since 2026-08-29:** the add-search covers all 7 instrument classes plus live lookups (`coin-search` for any CoinGecko coin, `stock-universe?symbol=` for any quotable ticker — the latter answers catalog-only without an FMP key); breakdown slices by class with crypto split by category; weighted risk averages only holdings with a vetted tier and discloses `riskCoveredPct` — non-catalog additions get `riskTier: null`, never a defaulted 5. Entry-price inputs label the quote unit (¢/%/pts/fx), since macro instruments aren't USD prices. **Look-through tab** (`lib/data/lookThrough.ts`): true underlying-issuer exposure across held funds + direct positions, a "held twice over" callout, and per-fund coverage. Weights are target allocations (stated on the panel). A partial holdings list is **never scaled to 100%** — the unexplained tail is reported, not redistributed |
| Pump Report | `/pump-report` | 🟢 Live | Public fraud-intelligence scan + chat over wallet addresses (`/live-data/pump-report/*`, own agent loop). **Promoted to its own page 2026-08-22**: it was a tab on `/wallets` and went dark when that page was held out of the rollout, purely because it had no route. The page reads saved wallets from the DB-backed store but carries **its own address entry**, so it does not depend on `/wallets` being reachable |
| Wallets | ~~`/wallets`~~ | ⚪ **Hidden from rollout** | **Hidden 2026-08-22** (owner), same posture as Transfer Fees — kept, not deleted; `/wallets` redirects to `/headlines`. On-chain balances for watched addresses + connected browser wallets (`/live-data/wallet/*`). `/api/user/wallets` is deliberately left up: user-data CRUD carries no staleness harm and saved addresses survive the hide. **DB-backed** since 2026-08-18 (NT3) via `/api/user/wallets` (+`/[id]` PATCH/DELETE) — optimistic store, client-UUID ids, one-time `fn:wallets` localStorage import that merges additively. **Exchange API linking removed 2026-08-18** on security grounds — see the secret-stores note above |
| Research / Agent Config | `/research`, `/agent-config` | — | Crypto + equity research agents; AI Agents tab configures all agents (see "AI Agents" section) |
| Risk Case Studies | `/backtests` | ⚪ Removed | Deleted (2026-07) — static educational replay of 3 depeg events with no clear user value; `/backtests` redirects to `/headlines`. Recoverable from the `archive/pre-reset-main` branch if ever wanted — the deletion predates the 2026-08-05 re-root of `main` (see "How Changes Land"), so it is not in `main`'s own history. (Equities Strategy Backtests at `/equities/backtests` are unrelated and remain.) |
| Videos | `/videos` | 🟢 Live | Video search + AI analysis (`/live-data/videos`, `video-search`, `video-analyze`) |
| Data Sources | `/data-sources` | — | Per-provider status and utilization, read from the provider registry |
| Daily Brief | `/brief` | 🟢 Live | AI morning brief grounded in holdings (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) |
| Compare | `/compare` | 🟡 Key-gated | 2–6 assets of ANY class (stocks/funds/coins + all 45 macro instruments — commodities/FX/rates ride `security-chart`, coverage provider-dependent), date-aligned growth-of-100 + window stats + correlation + **beta vs a selectable benchmark** (SPY/QQQ/IWM/VT/AGG/BTC, R² shown alongside) (`security-chart`, `chart`). Fund selections also get a **holdings-overlap** section (`lib/data/lookThrough.ts`) — the question correlation can't answer: whether two funds move together because they hold the same companies or because they track the same economy. Partial holdings lists are labelled as floors, never rescaled. **Cross-class comparisons get a structural panel** (`lib/data/assetClassProfiles.ts`, pure + tested): when ≥2 distinct asset classes are selected it states similarities and differences across five dimensions (what you own / income / valuation anchor / trading hours / supply) plus mix-specific method caveats (crypto weekend overlap, rate indices not investable, FX carry, NAV timing, futures roll). Facts only, class-level only — the advice line (RP-3) holds |
| Budget | ~~`/budget`~~ | ⚪ Removed | **Module removed 2026-08-20** — owner decision: personal-finance tooling moves to a separate product (*"we will build this out in a completely different tool"*). Pages, `/api/user/budget/*`, `lib/budget/` all deleted. **DB tables + imported bank history RETAINED** — schema definitions kept in `lib/db/schema/budget.ts` precisely so drizzle never generates a DROP; export instructions live in that file's banner. Reverses RP-2 via its recorded reopen trigger |
| Retirement Planner | ~~`/retirement`~~ | ⚪ Removed | **Module removed 2026-08-20** with Budget (same decision). `lib/retirement/` and its 53 tests deleted; recoverable by name from the **`archive/wave-two-pre-reset`** branch (kept deliberately, 2026-08-29 owner decision — do not delete) if the separate tool wants the engine — the §402(g) shared-cap and monthly-compounding fixes live there |
| Portfolio Builder | `/portfolio-builder` | 🟢 Derived | PREMIUM module (own entitlement). **Two modes since 2026-08-19 (item 16):** the guided questionnaire, and **build-by-allocation** (`buildFromAllocation`, `AllocationBuilder`) where the user sets class weights plus market-cap and sector sub-division. Both emit the same `BuiltPortfolio`, so a hand-built plan shares saved-plan storage, the drift monitor and `reviewPlan`. Weights must total 100 — they are **never** silently normalized. Questionnaire → diversified allocation with bond ladder, sector tilts/exclusions, fee summary, drift-vs-actual rebalancing and suitability monitoring. Engine is pure TS in `lib/data/portfolioBuilder.ts` (vitest-tested); see below |
| Trade Risk Scorer | `/equities/options` | 🟢 Derived | EQUITIES module. Describe an options position (1–4 legs in the UI; the API and agent tool accept up to 8, structure presets) and see it scored across liquidity, IV environment, assignment, time decay and defined risk — canonical 0–100 higher-is-safer, per-dimension with evidence. Engine is `lib/risk/profiles/optionsTrade.ts` (pure, tested). **There is deliberately NO options chain browser**: the P2-O1 audit found no usable keyless source (Cboe prohibited by its terms, Yahoo options 401s and Yahoo is now blocked outright on terms grounds), and the owner closed P2-O3 on 2026-08-05. Option-level numbers are hand-entered from the user's broker chain — never infer them. Also exposed as the `score_options_trade` agent tool, `POST /api/v1/options/score`, and an MCP tool |
| Settings | `/settings` (→ Integrations) | — | API keys, data tier, integrations + Suite Modules toggles |

### Equities module (`/equities`)
| Feature | Route | Status | Source / Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Stock Registry | `/equities` | 🟢 Live | Universe from `/live-data/stock-universe` (FMP stock-screener, daily-cached, all active common stocks + sectors) with `equityCatalog.ts` curated fallback when no FMP key. Paginated (50/page), live quotes for the visible page only, range screener, sortable columns incl. beta. Detail pages resolve non-catalog tickers via FMP profile lookup. **P/E is backfilled from SEC XBRL** — see below. |

#### P/E enrichment (`src/lib/server/secFundamentals.ts`)
FMP's `company-screener` returns **no P/E at all**, so on a paid plan every non-curated name would have a blank P/E column and be invisible to the registry's min/max P/E filter. `enrichPeRatios()` in the stock-universe route backfills it from the SEC's XBRL **frames** API (`data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/frames/...`) — bulk diluted EPS across all filers, with basic EPS as a gap-filler, keyed ticker→CIK via `edgar.ts`'s `fetchTickerCikMap()`. Free and keyless. Measured coverage: **~6,100 symbols**.

Caveats, all deliberate:
- It is a **trailing** P/E (last complete fiscal year's EPS ÷ reference price), so it won't match a broker's forward/TTM figure exactly.
- Loss-making companies return `null`, not a negative multiple — a negative P/E would corrupt the range filter (INTC is a live example).
- Coverage gaps: foreign private issuers (20-F), off-calendar fiscal years, and **recently reorganized registrants whose ticker now maps to a new holding-co CIK with no XBRL history** (XOM is a live example).
- Runs only on the FMP path — the 79-entry curated catalog already carries hand-written P/E, so enriching it would gain one row for three multi-MB fetches.
- Frame years derive from the clock (`recentAnnualFrames()`), so this does not go stale each January.
| Equity Detail | `/equities/[symbol]` | 🟢 Live | Live chart/news + reference stats, 52-wk range, key stats |
| Market News | `/equities/news` | 🟢 Live | RSS multi-feed; category/sentiment/ticker filters |
| Stock Social | `/equities/social` | 🟡 Partial | Reddit + StockTwits (keyless) sentiment |
| Equity TA | `/equities/technical-analysis` | 🟢 Derived | Shared candlestick engine, 62 indicators (shared registry), patterns |
| Equity Scanner | `/equities/scanner` | 🟢 Derived | **The section's one scanner** (items 6/7): the same seven setup detectors the crypto scanner runs, over the 79-name curated catalog, **merged with the AI Outlier Scan**. Replaced the 24-symbol RSI/SMA screener tab. No auto-refresh — every row is a keyed provider request, unlike crypto's keyless source; windows (3M/6M/1Y) change history depth, not bar size, because the provider serves daily bars only |
| Strategy Backtests | `/equities/backtests` | 🚫 Hidden | **HIDDEN 2026-08-20, deliberately recoverable** — owner: *"hide the back testing tool … I may revisit back testing."* All three backtest surfaces went dark the same way: this page (route now redirects to `/equities`), the crypto TA Backtest tab, and the Portfolios Backtest tab. Every engine (`equityBacktest.ts`, `backtest.ts`), panel component and test is retained in place; subproject P3-W2-S1 is suspended, not cancelled. Restore = delete the redirect + re-add the nav entry and tab unions (each site carries a comment saying exactly this) |
| Market Calendar | `/equities/calendar` | 🟡 Partial | FMP calendars (free key); earnings + US economic events |

### Macro Markets module (`/macro`) — bonds/rates, commodities, fiat
One module (`macro` entitlement), three areas. Owner spec + status: `docs/ROADMAP.md` ("Macro Markets"). **Zero new quote plumbing** — futures, FX pairs, and yield indices all price through the existing `security-quotes`/`security-chart`/`security-ohlcv` routes (verified). Catalogs carry **no reference prices** (futures/FX quotes stale in hours; unpriced = honest dash).

| Feature | Route | Status | Source / Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Macro Overview | `/macro` | 🟢 Live | Landing page; live quote strips per area |
| Macro News | `/macro/news` | 🟢 Live | `/live-data/macro-news` — 8 keyless RSS feeds (Investing.com commodities/bonds/forex, OilPrice, FXStreet, MarketWatch, CNBC ×2). **Content-first pillar classifier** (strong-currency terms → commodities → bonds → weak-currency; general-feed articles matching no pillar are dropped). 14-day staleness cutoff; future `pubDate`s clamped (Investing.com omits TZ); balanced merge guarantees each pillar ≤¼ of slots so slow bonds feeds aren't crowded out; detected instruments link to macro detail pages |
| Commodities | `/macro/commodities`, `/[slug]` | 🟢 Live | `commodityCatalog.ts` — 19 verified front-month contracts, 5 categories. `quoteBasis: 'usd'\|'cents'` renders each market's convention (472.75¢/bu, never "$472"). Detail: chart + facts + ETF proxies → /funds. **`etfProxies` are genuine single-commodity exposure**, not the broad-basket DBC these used to point to. Deep, multi-issuer lineups for the liquid metals/energy markets (gold: GLD/IAU/GLDM/SGOL/AAAU/BAR/OUNZ; silver: SLV/SIVR/PSLV; WTI: USO/OILK/USL; nat gas: UNG/UNL) — each variant genuinely differs (expense ratio, K-1 vs 1099 tax form, front-month vs laddered roll, physical-redemption feature), all added to `fundCatalog.ts` and verified both quotable AND actively trading (5-day history, not just a cached price) before inclusion. Copper/grain/platinum/palladium get one verified proxy each (CPER/CORN/WEAT/SOYB/CANE/PPLT/PALL) — genuinely thinner markets, not an under-researched gap; broad-basket funds (DBB, COPX-style miner ETFs) are deliberately excluded even as a single option since that's the exact overstated-specificity problem this fix corrected. Heating oil, coffee, cocoa, cotton, live cattle, and lean hogs are **deliberately empty** — their single-commodity ETFs/ETNs (UHN, JO, NIB, BAL, COW) were confirmed delisted (last trade 2019–2023) 2026-07-21; don't backfill with a basket fund to avoid a blank list |
| Currencies | `/macro/currencies`, `/[slug]` | 🟢 Live | `currencyCatalog.ts` — 17 pairs + DXY (18 entries), per-pair `precision`. **`etfProxies`** (new `FundCategoryId: 'currency'` in `fundCatalog.ts`): the 6 USD majors get their CurrencyShares trust (FXE/FXB/FXY/FXF/FXC/FXA — holds currency deposits, direct exposure); Dollar Index gets UUP/UDN/USDU (long/short/alt-index). Deliberately empty for every EM pair and every cross — EM single-currency funds (FXM/BZF/CYB/ICN/SZR) confirmed delisted, crosses have never had a dedicated fund (only vs-USD trusts exist), NZD/KRW never had one. **Converter is two-tier**: 30 ECB currencies (`/live-data/fx-rates`, frankfurter.dev — verified to be ECB's *complete* published set, not a subset) plus 127 more via `/live-data/fx-rates-extended` (community `fawazahmed0/currency-api`, keyless, hand-verified allowlist excluding crypto tickers/precious-metal ounce codes/IMF SDR/defunct pre-euro currencies from that feed's ~340 raw codes). Grouped by `<optgroup>` in the UI; any conversion touching an extended-tier currency shows a distinct disclosure (community-sourced, not ECB) instead of the "official" ECB copy — the two tiers are never blended without attribution |
| Bonds & Rates | `/macro/rates`, `/[slug]` | 🟢 Live | `ratesCatalog.ts` — 4 CBOE yield indices + 4 CBOT futures. **The four YIELD entries no longer use the quote ladder (2026-09-03, D3):** they read the official treasury.gov par curve via `lib/data/ratesFromCurve.ts` — keyless, plain percent, and published **daily**, so surfaces label them as a daily reading with no intraday change. The probe that forced this (`npm run rates-providers`) found no free provider quotes `^IRX`/`^FVX`/`^TNX`/`^TYX`: FMP paywalls them (HTTP 402), Finnhub returns nothing, Twelve Data 404s the symbol, Alpha Vantage returns an empty quote, Tiingo has no index space. Only the FUTURES still hit `security-quotes`. Curve chart from `/live-data/treasury-yield-curve` = **official** treasury.gov 13-maturity daily par curve (keyless XML, regex-parsed, 4h revalidate) + 2s10s/3m10y spreads + shape. Overview-page bond ETF shelf → /funds. **CUSIP-level bond quotes are licensed data — intentionally absent, stated on-page.** The overview shelf gained international and municipal rows (items 11/13); municipal fund detail pages carry a **tax-equivalent-yield calculator** (`lib/utils/taxEquivalentYield.ts`, pure + 10 tests) — a muni's headline yield is not comparable to a taxable fund's, and TEY is the arithmetic that makes it so. Detail pages carry a per-instrument **"Duration-Matched Funds"** section (`etfProxies`, distinct from the commodity/currency "ETF Proxies" naming since nobody buys "the 10-year yield" directly — the match is by maturity band, not asset identity): 13-week yield → SGOV/BIL (0-3mo bills); 5-year yield + 5yr future → IEI (3-7Y, added to fill the SHY↔IEF duration gap); 10-year yield + 10yr future → IEF; 30-year yield + 30yr future → TLT; 2yr future → SHY. General credit/inflation/aggregate funds (LQD/HYG/TIP/BND/AGG) stay overview-only since they don't map to a specific curve point |
| Macro Scanner | `/macro/scanner` | 🟢 Derived | The section's one scanner (items 6/7), moved off the TA page. RSI 14 / vs-SMA50 / composite over the **29 liquid** macro instruments; the 6 delisted-ETF commodities and 10 EM/cross FX pairs stay excluded and the exclusion is stated on-page |
| Macro TA | `/macro/technical-analysis` | 🟢 Derived | Shared candlestick/indicator engine over all 45 macro instruments — **no new data route**, macro symbols ride the same `security-ohlcv` path as equities. ⚠ That path is keyed and its macro coverage is narrower since the Yahoo removal — many macro symbols simply aren't carried by the remaining providers, and unpriced renders a dash. Chart tab (grouped picker, 5 ranges, 6 chart types, 16 indicators, patterns) + Scanner tab (RSI 14 / vs-SMA50 / composite signal). **Scanner covers 29 of 45**: the 6 delisted-ETF commodities and the 10 EM/cross FX pairs are excluded because their series gap enough that a ranked RSI beside a liquid contract reads as comparable when it isn't — the exclusion is stated on-page and all 45 still chart. Levels go through `formatInstrumentQuote()`, so grains stay ¢/bu and yields stay % |

`PriceChartCard` takes `valueFormat: 'usd' | 'plain'` (default `'usd'`, existing pages unchanged) — use `'plain'` for FX, yields, and cents-quoted contracts so axes aren't $-mislabeled. **Cross-cutting integration shipped 2026-07-21**: `market: 'macro'` exists across the provider registry (11 built-in rows; macro routes are registry-driven with utilization), tier categories, Integrations sections, and agents (`macro-research`/`macro-screener`, toolset `'macro'`); all 45 macro instruments (19 commodities + 18 currencies + 8 rates) are `sec:`-keyed entries in `instruments.ts` (classes `commodity`/`currency`/`rate`, `detailPath` slug routing) so watchlists/portfolios/Compare can hold them.

### ETFs & Funds module (`/funds`)
| Feature | Route | Status | Source / Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Fund Registry | `/funds` | 🟡 Key-gated | `fundCatalog.ts` + live quotes; 126 ETFs/mutual funds (8 added 2026-08-19 for items 11/13: BNDX/IAGG/BWX/EMB/VWOB international, MUB/VTEB/TFI municipal). Catalog carries provenance (`getFundDataProvenance()`, stale after 120d) rendered on detail pages — its expense ratios are computed on by `computeFeeDrag`, the builder's fee math, and `reviewPlan`'s fee-creep check |
| Fund Detail | `/funds/[symbol]` | 🟢 Live | Live chart/news + fund facts; Fee Drag Analyzer, top holdings. **The analyzer accounts for sales loads since 2026-09-03**: a verified rate enters the projection, an unverified one is disclosed in an amber panel that says plainly the figures understate the cost and links the prospectus. AGTHX is the live example — a Class A front-end load roughly DOUBLES its ten-year cost versus the 0.59% expense ratio alone, and none of it was shown before |

---

## AI Agents (`src/lib/agents/`)

All agents run through one loop (`runner.ts`, Anthropic + OpenAI-compatible). Defaults live in `prompts.ts` (`AGENT_DEFAULTS`); per-agent overrides (provider/model/temperature/systemPrompt/**enabled**) persist to `.agent-prompts.json`. Each agent has a `market: 'crypto' | 'equities' | 'macro'` (undefined = shared) and a `toolset: 'crypto' | 'equities' | 'macro' | 'all'`.

**Agents (11):** `app-assistant` (shared, toolset `all`), crypto `research-analyst` / `data-scraper` / `pump-report-investigator` / `pump-report-chat`, equity `equity-research` / `equity-screener` / `equity-data-scraper` / `equity-diligence`, and macro `macro-research` / `macro-screener` (6 macro tools: search_macro_instruments, get_macro_quote, get_macro_price_history, get_yield_curve, get_fx_rates, get_macro_news).

**Tools (`tools.ts`):** tagged by market; `toolsForAgent(toolset)` gives an agent only its market's tools. `score_options_trade` is the one tool that POSTs (a multi-leg trade doesn't fit a query string) and the one that computes rather than fetches — its prompt text carries the no-chain-feed rule, so an agent asks the user for a missing bid instead of inventing one. Crypto tools hit `/api/v1/*` + `/live-data/ohlcv`; equity tools (`get_stock_quote/financials/profile/filings/news/social/price_history`) hit the equity `/live-data/*` routes. Every tool reads exactly what the UI reads — one source of truth. The Anthropic runner also adds the server-side **`web_search`** tool (max_uses via `opts.webSearchMaxUses`, default 5 / research 8), and handles the `pause_turn` stop reason it produces; web search is **Anthropic-only** (agents switched to another provider keep data tools but lose search).

**Invocation:** `app-assistant` (Assistant chat → `/api/agents/chat`), `research-analyst` / `equity-research` / `macro-research` (Research page Crypto/Equities/Macro selector → `/api/agents/research`), and `equity-screener` (Stock Registry "AI Outlier Scan" panel → `/api/agents/research`, whitelisted; calls `get_stock_outliers` then drills in) have run triggers. `macro-screener` is whitelisted on the research route (deep-linkable via `?agent=macro-screener`) but has no dedicated panel yet. `data-scraper` / `equity-data-scraper` / `equity-diligence` gained real invocation paths on 2026-08-18 (NT5): the Research page now carries a **per-market agent picker**, so every whitelisted agent — including the two screeners, previously deep-link-only — is selectable. `lib/agents/__tests__/researchAgents.test.ts` guards picker ↔ route ↔ catalog symmetry so an agent cannot go configurable-but-unrunnable again. `pump-report-*` run via their own `/live-data/pump-report/*` routes (separate loop, own web_search).

**LLM keys** resolve via `getProviderKey(provider)` — UI-saved key (Integrations → AI Providers, the `llm`-category providers in `providers.ts`) first, then the env var. The pump-report routes resolve the Anthropic key the same way.

**Control surfaces:** the **AI Agents tab** (`/agent-config`) edits model/temperature/prompt per agent (tabs grouped shared/crypto/equity); **Integrations** (`/settings`) holds the AI Providers key section and per-agent enable toggles. The **Research page** (`/research`) has a Crypto/Equities selector and accepts `?symbol=` / `?agent=equity-research` deep links; stock detail pages have an **Analyze with AI** button → `/research?symbol=…`. Disabled agents throw `AgentDisabledError` (503) from the run routes.

## News Feed Architecture (`src/app/live-data/news/route.ts`)

The news route has a multi-layer asset detection system:
1. **Direct mention** — regex patterns for coin names/tickers (e.g. "bitcoin", "BTC")
2. **Issuer match** — "Circle" → USDC, "Tether" → USDT
3. **Regulatory inference** — "MiCA" → USDC+USDT, "GENIUS Act" → USDC+USDT+PYUSD, "DeFi regulation" → DAI+FRAX
4. **Category fallback** — "stablecoin" with no match → general stablecoins; "crypto/blockchain" → general

Asset filter is applied server-side so only relevant articles are returned when a coin filter is active. Articles tagged `'general'` always pass through.

---

## Agent API Layer (`/api/v1/`)

A separate, agent-optimised REST API lives at `/api/v1/`. It is distinct from `/live-data/*` (which is internal to the UI) — the v1 API is designed for programmatic consumption by AI agents, external scripts, and other services.

### Key differences from `/live-data/*`
- All routes include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` CORS headers
- Responses are flat and descriptive (no UI-specific shape)
- Proper HTTP 400 errors with human-readable messages for bad params
- Every response includes `updatedAt` and `source` metadata
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec available at `GET /api/v1/openapi.json`

### Available endpoints
| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v1/` | Discovery — lists all endpoints and supported coins/networks |
| `GET /api/v1/prices?coins=btc,eth` | Live USD prices |
| `GET /api/v1/exchanges?tier=1` | All supported exchanges with ids, coins, networks |
| `GET /api/v1/network-fees` | Gas fees for all 16 networks (BTC live, rest estimated) |
| `GET /api/v1/transfer/routes?from=binance&to=coinbase&coin=usdt&amount=1000` | Transfer route finder |
| `GET /api/v1/staking/opportunities?coin=eth&category=liquid&max_risk=5` | Staking options with risk scores |
| `GET /api/v1/news?coin=btc&sentiment=negative&limit=10` | News with sentiment/category tagging |
| `GET /api/v1/securities/quotes?symbols=AAPL,VOO,GC=F` | Stock/ETF/fund/macro quotes (max 25; same keyed ladder + reference fallback as the UI, `reference: true` rows labeled) |
| `GET /api/v1/securities/history?symbol=AAPL&range=1y` | Daily close history for any quotable symbol (1mo–max) |
| `GET /api/v1/macro/yield-curve` | Official treasury.gov 13-maturity par curve + 2s10s/3m10y spreads + shape |
| `GET /api/v1/macro/fx-rates?symbols=EUR,JPY` | Daily ECB reference FX (official tier only — extended community tier deliberately not exposed) |
| `POST /api/v1/options/score` | Score a described options position on the canonical safety scale. **Computes, doesn't fetch** — there is no chain feed, so the caller supplies every option-level figure. `GET` on the same path returns the schema. Explains risk; never recommends |
| `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` | Full OpenAPI 3.0 spec |

### CORS helper
All v1 routes import from `src/app/api/_cors.ts`:
```typescript
import { CORS, options } from '../../_cors'
export { options as OPTIONS }   // handles preflight
// ...
return NextResponse.json(data, { headers: CORS })
```

## MCP Server (`mcp-server/`)

A standalone Node.js MCP server at `mcp-server/` (repo root) that exposes Finance Now tools to Claude and any MCP-compatible AI agent. It calls the `/api/v1/` endpoints — Finance Now frontend must be running.

### Tools exposed
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_coin_prices` | Live prices for one or more coins |
| `list_exchanges` | All supported exchanges with coin/network support |
| ~~`find_transfer_routes`~~ | ⚪ **WITHHELD 2026-08-22** — Transfer Fees held out of the initial rollout; tool commented out in mcp-server, `/api/v1/transfer/routes` answers 503 |
| `get_network_fees` | Gas fees for all 16 networks |
| `get_staking_opportunities` | Staking options filtered by coin, category, max risk |
| `compare_staking_risk` | Side-by-side risk comparison of staking providers |
| `get_crypto_news` | Recent news with sentiment, category, and coin tags |
| `get_security_quotes` | Stock/ETF/fund/macro quotes (reference prices flagged) |
| `get_security_history` | Daily close history + 52-week range for any quotable symbol |
| `get_yield_curve` | Official Treasury par curve with spreads and shape |
| `get_fx_rates` | Daily ECB reference FX rates (official tier) |
| `run_audit` | ⚠ Dev/maintenance tool, not market data: shells out (`npx tsc`), probes live-data routes, walks the frontend source tree. Whether it ships in any externally distributed build is an **open owner decision (P3 review D5)** — documented here so the tool count stops drifting, not as an endorsement |
| `score_options_trade` | Risk-score a user-described options position (0–100, higher = safer, per-dimension) |

### Setup (build once)
```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

### Add to Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "finance-now": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path-to-repo>/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": { "FN_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:3000" }
    }
  }
}
```
Claude Desktop config lives at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows.

### Add to Claude Code (project-level MCP)
```bash
# Run from any directory — adds Finance Now MCP to this project's .claude/settings.json
claude mcp add finance-now node <path-to-repo>/mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

### Environment variable
`FN_BASE_URL` — base URL of running Finance Now instance (default: `http://localhost:3000`; legacy `CAEP_BASE_URL` still honored)

---

## Testing conventions

`vitest.config.ts` aliases **`server-only`** to `test/stubs/server-only.ts`. That import is a
Next *build-time* poison pill (it fails the bundle if a module reaches the client), not a runtime
dependency, so it does not exist in `node_modules` — vitest could not resolve it, and all seven
`lib/server/` modules importing it were untestable. The alias restores that; the real bundler check
is unaffected. Add tests for `lib/server/` freely.

`lib/server/sourceTerms.ts` and `termsProbe.ts` are pure and tested for the same reason —
`sourceTerms.test.ts` doubles as the repo-wide guard that every host in `dataSources.ts`
carries a terms verdict, so a new undocumented source fails the suite rather than shipping.

Anything producing a **dollar figure or a percentage a user acts on** should be pure and tested:
`computeNetworkFees()`, `computeFeeDrag()`, `portfolioBuilder.ts`, `lookThrough.ts`,
`lib/risk/`. Where a function needs the clock, take an injectable `now` — every provenance helper
and `reviewPlan()`/`buildCurveData()` do, and it is the only reason their edge cases are testable.

## Common Patterns

### Resilient multi-fetch — pick the boundary that matches the shape

**Independent fetches** (all results wanted, order irrelevant) → `Promise.allSettled`:
```typescript
const [res1, res2] = await Promise.allSettled([fetch(url1), fetch(url2)])
if (res1.status === 'fulfilled' && res1.value.ok) { /* use it */ }
// always fall through to static defaults if fetch fails
```

**Sequential fallback ladder** (try A, else B, else C — `markets`, `portfolio-prices`, `cbdc-data`) → per-leg
try/catch, returning on first success. **Do not "upgrade" these to `allSettled`**: it fires every provider in
parallel, burning rate limit on exactly the calls the ladder exists to avoid. The 2026-07-22 pass found 7 of 8
routes flagged for "missing allSettled" were already correct for this reason.

**Sequential accumulate-until-satisfied** (walk pages until you have enough — `sec-filings` archives) → try/catch
*inside* the loop, `break` on failure and report the range as incomplete. The bug this fixed: a thrown page fetch
propagated out and 503'd the route, throwing away filings already collected.

### Adding a coin to the transfer fee calculator
1. Add to `CoinId` union type in `transferFees.ts`
2. Add entry to `COIN_INFO` record
3. Add `GAS_AMOUNTS` entry in `network-fees/route.ts` if it has its own network
4. Add per-exchange network entries in `EXCHANGES` array for each exchange that supports it
5. Update coin selector grid columns in `transfer-fees/page.tsx` if needed

### Adding an exchange to the transfer fee calculator
1. Append to `EXCHANGES` array in `transferFees.ts`
2. Include all coin/network combinations that exchange supports
3. Use `tier: 1` for top-25 by volume, `tier: 2` for smaller exchanges
4. Note: Hyperliquid (DEX) is already included as a special case with Arbitrum-only withdrawal
