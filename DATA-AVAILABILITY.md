# Finance Now — Data Availability Report

_Last generated: **2026-07-20**, from a full audit of all `/live-data/*` route handlers
executed against a running dev server on the development machine. This document is the
authoritative record of **what data in Finance Now is live, what is partially live, and what has
no free real-time source**. It exists so that a walk-through of the app surfaces exactly
what is — and is not — backed by real data, with no fabricated figures presented as real._

> **Companion doc:** [`DATA-SOURCES.md`](./DATA-SOURCES.md) is the "**where does each surface's data come
> from**" inventory — generated from `frontend/src/lib/data/dataSources.ts` (`npm run data-sources`), the same
> registry that powers the in-app **/data-sources** page and per-page source badges. This file tracks *whether*
> a surface is live; that one tracks *who* provides it.
>
> **Reproduce this report:** `npm run audit` in `frontend/` with the app running.
> The harness (`scripts/test-live-data.mjs`) classifies every route as
> REAL / FALLBACK / UNCONFIGURED / EMPTY / FAIL rather than just pass/fail.
> `npm run smoke` runs the fast CI subset. **Do not hand-edit the statuses below
> without re-running the audit** — that is how this file went stale last time.

> ### Correction pass — 2026-09-08
>
> Seven rows below asserted a state the code contradicts. Each was corrected in
> place with a dated marker, under the owner's 2026-09-08 ruling on the
> checklist-steward flow: **apply where the evidence is a file-and-line
> contradiction with no judgement in it; propose the judgement calls.** All seven
> are the first kind — the code says what it says.
>
> | Row | Was | Is |
> |---|---|---|
> | `network-fees` (×2 places) | "Only Bitcoin's fee is live" | 5 of 18 live — BTC plus ETH/BNB/Polygon/AVAX (`networkFees.ts` FEE_PROVIDERS). L2s stay estimates on purpose |
> | Risk scores | 🟢 Derived | ⚪ Removed 2026-08-29 (RP-6) — no per-coin score is published anywhere |
> | Exchange connections | 🟢 Live | ⚪ Removed 2026-08-18 (RP-5) — routes and credential store deleted |
> | Fund asset mix | "no source at all" | Derived from N-PORT `assetCat` (NT9, `lib/utils/assetMix.ts`) |
> | Stock social | "Known issue: Reddit is starved" | Fixed 2026-07-22 (`socialBlend.ts`); Reddit is now gated by robots.txt instead |
>
> **Nothing here re-measures anything.** These correct claims about which code
> exists — which is a reading, not a measurement. Every LIVE/PARTIAL verdict that
> depends on reaching an upstream still needs `npm run audit` on the owner's
> machine, for the IP-dependence reason stated above.

> ⚠ **2026-08-06 — YAHOO FINANCE REMOVED AS A DATA SOURCE. THE STATUSES BELOW ARE
> PRE-REMOVAL FOR EVERY SURFACE IT TOUCHED, AND `npm run audit` HAS NOT BEEN RE-RUN
> SINCE (it must run on the owner's machine — see the note above).**
>
> Yahoo was withdrawn on **terms grounds, not availability**: the
> `query1/query2.finance.yahoo.com` v8/v10 endpoints are undocumented internals of
> Yahoo's own web app with no published third-party API terms, and Yahoo's ToS
> prohibit automated access and redistribution. It is now hard-blocked in code —
> `frontend/src/lib/server/sourceTerms.ts` refuses `*.yahoo.com` at the socket, so
> re-adding a fetcher does not bring it back.
>
> It was the only **keyless** rung on the equity/fund/macro quote, chart and OHLCV
> paths, so the honest expectation for the next audit run is:
>
> | Surface | Was | Expected now |
> |---|---|---|
> | Quotes (stocks/ETFs/funds) | 🟢 Live keyless | 🟡 **Key-gated** — FMP/Finnhub/Twelve Data/Tiingo/Alpha Vantage, else catalog `ref` prices |
> | Price chart | 🟢 Live keyless | 🟡 **Key-gated** — Tiingo → FMP |
> | OHLCV / TA / backtests | 🟢 Live keyless | 🟡 **Key-gated** — Tiingo → FMP |
> | Trailing returns | 🟢 Live keyless | 🟡 **Key-gated**, and capped: one request per symbol, so whole-universe requests are now REFUSED rather than truncated. Fund return screening/sorting is off; the Returns columns still work per page |
> | Market news | 🟢 Live keyless | 🟡 **Partial** — MarketWatch + CNBC only. The one free per-ticker feed was Yahoo's; symbol news is now the general wires filtered to articles that name the company |
> | Fund holdings | 🟢 Live keyless | 🟢 **Unchanged** — SEC N-PORT is authoritative and keyless. Sector weights now need an FMP key (N-PORT carries no GICS classification). The stock/bond/cash **asset mix is derived from N-PORT's `assetCat`** (NT9, `lib/utils/assetMix.ts`), so it is keyless and unaffected too — the earlier "no source at all" note was written before that work and is superseded. Absent only for filers publishing no N-PORT (UITs such as SPY) |
> | Commodity / FX quotes | ⬜ Not measured | 🟡 **Key-gated and expected partial** — `GC=F`, `EURUSD=X` are not covered by Tiingo, so coverage depends on which keyed provider is configured. **This is the surface hit hardest.** |
> | Treasury yield indices (`^IRX`/`^FVX`/`^TNX`/`^TYX`) | ⬜ Not measured | 🟢 **Keyless since 2026-09-03 (D3)** — no longer quoted at all. Probed with real keys on the owner's machine (`npm run rates-providers`): FMP paywalls them (402), Finnhub returns nothing, Twelve Data 404s the symbol, Alpha Vantage returns an empty quote, Tiingo has no index space. They now read the official treasury.gov par curve instead — keyless and plain percent, but **daily**, so no intraday change |
> | Futures term structure | 🟢 Live (P2-O4) | 🔴 **Not available** — nothing reachable quotes a dated contract month. The route resolves the months and returns `ok:false` with the reason; the card states it on-page |
> | FX converter, Treasury yield curve, SEC filings/XBRL, all crypto | — | 🟢 **Unaffected** — keyless and unrelated |
>
> Everything above is a *prediction from the code*, not a measurement. Re-run
> `npm run audit` on the owner's machine and replace this block with what it says.
>
> A companion safeguard shipped in the same change: every external host now carries a
> dated terms verdict in `sourceTerms.ts`, a vitest fails if a host in `dataSources.ts`
> has no verdict, and user-added feeds are checked against the site's robots.txt and
> terms (`termsProbe.ts`) before they can be saved. See
> `docs/architecture/source-terms.md`.

> ✅ **RE-MEASURED 2026-07-29 (second run, evening) on the owner's machine** — `npm run audit`,
> app on localhost:3000, tree at **`54fbf0c`**. Headline: **76 checks — 60 REAL, 9 FALLBACK,
> 3 UNCONFIGURED, 1 EMPTY, 3 FAIL.** Macro is measured for the first time.
>
> **Two fixes verified by this run, both previously unconfirmed:**
>
> - **Crypto news is live again.** `news` → REAL (10 articles from **4 providers**) and
>   `v1 news` → REAL (5 articles). The morning run had both FAILING, which took out `/news`,
>   the crypto half of `/headlines`, and the `get_crypto_news` agent tool. The cause was
>   structural, not a feed outage: every built-in crypto news provider required an API key and
>   CryptoPanic's free tier ended April 2026, so with no key saved the route found zero
>   providers. The keyless RSS built-ins (CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, Decrypt, Bitcoin Magazine)
>   resolve from the owner's network — the thing the dev container could not test.
> - **`btc-stats` reports a real hashrate: 828 EH/s.** It read `0 EH/s` in both earlier runs
>   while block height advanced normally, because the route divided blockchain.info's GH/s
>   figure by `1e12` as though it were H/s. This is the measurement that confirms the
>   magnitude-inference fix, and it is worth noting *the audit classified that route REAL
>   throughout* — a wrong field inside a healthy payload is invisible to the REAL/FALLBACK
>   split, which is why the number itself had to be read.
>
> **Macro, measured at last** (the rows below are no longer ⬜): `macro-news` REAL — 20
> articles across 3 pillars; `fx-rates` REAL — 30 ECB currencies, `source=frankfurter-ecb`;
> `treasury-yield-curve` REAL — 13 maturities, 2s10s=0.45, 3m10y=0.84, shape=normal;
> `fx-rates-extended` **FALLBACK** — 124 of 126 allowlisted currencies priced, KPW and SYP
> unpriced upstream. That last one is the community tier degrading honestly, not a bug.
>
> ### The 3 remaining failures are one cause, not three
>
> `coin-discovery` (**explicit HTTP 429**), `portfolio-history` (`source=error`) and `alerts`
> (`ok:false`) all call CoinGecko, and `markets` / `coin-list` / `coin-search` succeeded
> earlier in the same run. This is the free tier's rate limit tripping partway through a burst
> of ~8 CoinGecko-backed checks — a **harness artifact**, not three broken routes. Re-running
> after a pause, or configuring `COINGECKO_API_KEY`, should clear all three together.
>
> `alerts` is new to the failure list only because `news` vacated it; it is not a regression
> (the route hardcodes its CoinGecko URL — no provider registry, no `pinnedFetch`).
>
> **Harness gap this exposed:** `alerts` reported bare `not ok` with no reason, because ten
> checks threw `'not ok'` while discarding the route's own `error` field. All ten now surface
> it. An unactionable failure line is its own kind of silent degradation — it sends the reader
> to the wrong layer, which is the exact failure this file exists to prevent.
>
> **Earlier the same day**, a first run (tree `d79c5d2`, 72 checks — 56 REAL, 8 FALLBACK,
> 3 UNCONFIGURED, 1 EMPTY, 4 FAIL) closed audit finding H3 and corrected two claims this
> document had asserted without measuring:
>
> 1. **The staking claim was wrong in the other direction.** The 2026-07-28 warning here
>    said PR #37's rewrite meant "only 4 of 28 live" no longer held. Measured, it is
>    **4 of 51 live** — the rewrite added providers to the catalog without adding live rate
>    sources, so the *proportion* got worse, not better. The warning was itself an
>    unverified claim, which is precisely the failure mode this file exists to prevent.
>    Re-confirmed at **4/51** in the evening run.
> 2. **The macro rows could never have been filled by running the audit** — the harness had
>    **no macro checks at all**. Four routes shipped 2026-07-21 and were never added to
>    `scripts/test-live-data.mjs`, so the doc gap and the harness gap were the same gap.
>    Macro coverage was added 2026-07-29 (4 checks) and the evening run exercised them.
>
> Statuses remain IP-dependent (see CLAUDE.md) — this run is from the owner's network, where
> Binance.com is geo-blocked and Reddit rate-limits. A datacenter run produces different,
> systematically worse answers.

## Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 **Live** | Sourced from a real external provider at request time. |
| 🟡 **Partial** | Some fields live, others are static reference values or labeled estimates. |
| 🔑 **Key-gated** | Needs an API key/paid plan the project does not have. Route reports `configured: false` honestly. |
| 🔴 **Not available** | No free real-time source. The UI shows an explicit "not available" notice — never fabricated numbers. |
| ⬜ **Not measured** | The surface exists in code but has never been through an audit run. **Not a status** — an admission that one is owed. Never leave a row here after a regeneration. |

---

## ⚠️ Environment dependence — read this first

**This report is only valid from a network where these upstreams are reachable.**
Several providers geo-block or bot-block, and the results differ by IP. Verified
**2026-07-20** from the development machine:

| Upstream | Result | Consequence |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `api.binance.com` | **451** (geo-blocked) | All crypto OHLCV silently served by Binance.US instead |
| `api.binance.us` | 200 | The de-facto crypto candle source |
| `fapi.binance.com` (futures) | **451** | `funding-rates` uses OKX instead |
| `api.okx.com` | 200 | Funding rates + open interest |
| Coinbase / Kraken public | 200 | Unused reachable fallbacks if more are ever needed |
| `min-api.cryptocompare.com` | **401** | Now requires a key; unusable keyless |
| CoinGecko free | 200 (intermittent **429**) | Rate-limited under load; 60 s polling floor |
| Reddit `*.json` (API) | **403** — all subs, all UAs | Unusable server-side without OAuth |
| Reddit `*.rss` (Atom) | 200, then **429** | Works, but ~1 request per window per IP |
| `lunarcrush.com/api3` | **404** | Endpoint gone; also behind Cloudflare |
| `stooq.com` CSV quotes | **404** | Dead — bottom rung of the quote ladder no longer functions |
| `cloudflare-eth.com` | JSON-RPC `-32603` | **Fixed:** ETH wallet route now uses a fallback ladder |
| `polygon-rpc.com` | 403 "tenant disabled" | **Fixed:** same ladder |
| `kobe.mainnet.jito.network/api/v1/apy` | **404** | **Fixed:** switched to `/stake_pool_stats` |
| SEC EDGAR / data.sec.gov | 200 | Keyless and authoritative — filings, XBRL, N-PORT |
| ~~Yahoo Finance spark/chart~~ | 200 | **NOT USED SINCE 2026-08-06 — removed on terms grounds, not availability.** Reachability is beside the point: there are no published third-party API terms for these endpoints. Hard-blocked in `sourceTerms.ts` |
| ~~Yahoo Finance **v8 chart, individual futures months**~~ (`CLZ26.NYM`) | 200 | **Measured 2026-08-05 (P2-O1):** 9/9 across NYMEX/COMEX/CBOT, 64 daily bars. Unblocks the futures term-structure view (P2-O4) — same API already in production |
| ~~Yahoo Finance **options**~~ (`v7/finance/options`) | **401** — both hosts, all symbols | **Measured 2026-08-05 (P2-O1):** auth wall, not a rate limit. The keyless options-chain path is closed. Note Yahoo chart answered 10/10 in the same run — Yahoo is reachable; Yahoo *options* is gated |
| `cdn.cboe.com` delayed options quotes | 200, complete (greeks + IV + OI) | **Measured 2026-08-05 (P2-O1): technically perfect, PROHIBITED BY TERMS.** Cboe forbids auto-extraction of delayed quote data and blocks the IPs that attempt it; programmatic use runs through the paid All Access API. Not used, and not to be added. Owner decision 2026-08-05: options chains stay not-available; the Trade Risk Scorer takes hand-entered legs instead — see `docs/assessments/P2-O1-options-data.md` |
| StockTwits | 200 | Keyless equity social |
| DefiLlama, mempool.space, alternative.me, Lido, Marinade | 200 | All healthy |

**Key-gating vs geo-blocking are different problems.** A route needing a paid FMP plan
(`stock-universe`, `market-calendar`) is a commercial decision. A route blocked by IP
(`ohlcv`, `funding-rates`, Reddit) cannot be fixed by paying anyone.

---

## 🔴 Silent degradation — routes that return HTTP 200 with non-live data

**This is the most important section.** These routes look healthy to any status-code
check. They are not lying about their data, but a caller that ignores the provenance
field will treat catalog/reference/estimate values as live readings.

| Route | Looks like | Actually is | Provenance field |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| `ohlcv` | `source: "binance"` | **Binance.US**, a different venue with its own liquidity and prices | `venue: "binance-us"` (added 2026-07-20) |
| `stock-universe` | 79 stocks, `ok: true` | Curated `equityCatalog.ts` fallback — the real universe is thousands | `source: "catalog"` |
| `stock-outliers` | Sector z-score screener | Screens only those 79 catalog names, so "outlier" means outlier within a hand-picked large-cap set | inherits `stock-universe` |
| `staking-rates` | **51** APRs, `ok: true` | **Only 4 are live** (stETH, rETH, mSOL, jitoSOL); the other **47** are static estimates. Re-measured 2026-07-29 — the catalog grew 28→51 without new live sources | `sources: { key: "live" \| "estimate" }` |
| `network-fees` | 18 networks with USD fees | **5 of 18 are live** (Bitcoin via mempool.space; ETH / BNB / Polygon / AVAX via keyless `eth_gasPrice`, added 2026-08-21, `01d6bfe`). The other 13 are static gas × live price. **The L2s are estimates on purpose** — `eth_gasPrice` omits their L1 data fee, which is most of the real cost — so the remaining work here is non-EVM chains, not L2s. *(Corrected 2026-09-08: this row said "only Bitcoin", written before the EVM-L1 work.)* | per-network `source: "estimate"`, `btcFeeSource` |
| `cbdc-data` | 55 countries | Entirely the static table; the live CBDC news feed did not resolve | `source: "fallback"` |
| `fund-holdings` (SPY) | 5 holdings | Catalog's indicative top holdings. **Expected** — SPY is a unit investment trust and files no N-PORT | `source: "catalog"`, `full: false` |
| `chart` | OHLCV candles | **Synthesised** — `open==high==low==close`; built from a price-only series | `synthetic: true` (added 2026-07-20) |
| `security-quotes` | Live prices | Falls back to catalog reference prices if the whole ladder fails | `source: "reference"`, per-quote `reference: true` |

**The audit harness now fails-loud on all of these** (🟡 FALLBACK), so they cannot pass
silently again. Run `npm run audit:strict` to make them exit non-zero.

---

## Run of 2026-07-29 — measured results

`npm run audit`, owner's machine, app on localhost:3000, tree at `54fbf0c` (evening run).
**76 checks: 60 REAL · 9 FALLBACK · 3 UNCONFIGURED · 1 EMPTY · 3 FAIL.**

### 🔴 Failures (3) — all three are one cause

| Check | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| `coin-discovery` | **HTTP 503** — CoinGecko markets unavailable, page 1 returned HTTP 429 (rate limited). |
| `portfolio-history` | **No historical prices** (`source=error`). CoinGecko history. |
| `alerts` | **`ok:false`** on a single CoinGecko `simple/price` call for 30 ids. |

**Do not chase these as three bugs.** All three call CoinGecko, and `markets`, `coin-list`
and `coin-search` succeeded earlier in the same run — the free tier's rate limit trips
partway through a burst of ~8 CoinGecko-backed checks. Re-run after a pause, or configure
`COINGECKO_API_KEY`, and expect all three to clear together. `alerts` is new to this list
only because `news` vacated it, and is **not** a regression: the route hardcodes its
CoinGecko URL, with no provider registry and no `pinnedFetch` involvement.

**Fixed since the morning run:** `news` and `v1 news`, both now REAL — see the verification
note at the top of this file.

> The morning run listed `alerts` as a bare `not ok` with no reason, because ten harness
> checks threw `'not ok'` and threw away the route's own `error` field. All ten now surface
> it (`j.error ?? 'not ok'`). A failure line you cannot act on sends the reader to the wrong
> layer — the same class of problem as a 200 carrying fallback data.

### 🟡 Silent degradation (8) — 200 OK, not the intended source

`ohlcv` btc/xrp/eth (Binance.com geo-blocked → Binance.US, a different venue) ·
`chart` (synthetic OHLC, correctly marked `synthetic: true`) ·
`cbdc-data` (static table; live feed unavailable) ·
`stock-universe` (79 curated names — FMP screener needs a paid plan) ·
`stock-outliers` (66 evaluable names across 7 sectors, inherited) ·
`fund-holdings` SPY (expected — a UIT files no N-PORT).

### 🔑 Unconfigured (3) — honestly reported

`video-search` and `market-calendar` (no YouTube / FMP key) · `fund-holdings-history` for
SPY (no N-PORT series *and* no FMP key).

### ⚪ Empty (1)

`wallet exchange-connections` — 0 configured, which is correct for a fresh install.

> **Overtaken, 2026-09-08.** This run record is left as measured. The surface it
> measured no longer exists: exchange API linking was removed on 2026-08-18 under
> **RP-5** (it stored an apiKey + apiSecret in plaintext at rest — the highest-value
> secret the app held — to power a read-only balance view that watched addresses
> already approximate from public chain data). Both `/live-data/wallet/exchange*`
> routes and `lib/server/exchangeCredentials.ts` are deleted.

### 🐢 Slow (>3s)

`staking-discovery` **21.8s** · `fund-universe` **12.4s** (28,988 funds) ·
`staking-rates` **6.7s** · `defi-tvl` **3.2s**. The first two are the standing
pagination/performance items, and both are marginally slower than the morning run — noise at
this sample size, not a trend.

### What this run could not answer

The four **Macro** routes were not exercised — the harness had no macro group. Coverage was
added 2026-07-29; their rows stay ⬜ **Not measured** until the next run.

## Summary by feature

### Crypto — market data
| Feature / Page | Status | Source | Notes |
|----------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Asset prices, market cap, volume, 24h change | 🟢 Live | CoinGecko (`/live-data/markets`) | 78 assets. Metadata from static catalog — reference data, not fabricated. |
| Asset OHLCV / price charts | 🟡 Partial | **Binance.US** → CoinGecko fallback | Binance.com is 451 here, so candles come from the US mirror — different venue, different prices. `venue` field records which. |
| Coin list / search / discovery | 🟢 Live | CoinGecko | 750 coins, 209 discovery candidates. |
| Fear & Greed Index | 🟢 Live | alternative.me | |
| Funding rates + open interest | 🟢 Live | **OKX** (Binance fapi is 451 here) | 10 instruments. |
| DeFi TVL | 🟢 Live | DefiLlama | 50 protocols. |
| BTC network stats | 🟢 Live | blockchain.info + mempool.space | Height, hashrate, difficulty, mempool. Hashrate **unit is inferred from magnitude** (`lib/server/btcHashrate.ts`), not assumed: the upstream sends GH/s and a hardcoded `/1e12` reported `0 EH/s` while block height advanced normally (fixed 2026-07-29). Returns `null` — rendered as not-available — rather than a figure it cannot justify. A wrong field inside an otherwise healthy payload is the one failure the REAL/FALLBACK split cannot catch. |
| Reserves / collateralization | 🟢 Live | DefiLlama Stablecoins API | 9 stablecoins. Composition breakdown is **approximate / derived** from chain distribution, not issuer attestation. |
| Risk scores | ⚪ **Removed 2026-08-29 (RP-6)** | — | **No per-coin risk score is published anywhere.** Owner: a risk figure on an asset the reader is viewing may be read as a recommendation, which is a regulated activity. `/live-data/risk-scores`, `lib/api/live/riskScores.ts`, `useRiskScoreIndex`, `RiskScoreBadge` and the `Asset.riskScore`/`riskBand` fields are all gone, and `lib/risk/__tests__/riskScoringRemoved.test.ts` guards it. **`lib/risk/` itself stays** — the options Trade Risk Scorer, staking-provider risk and the macro/equity profiles are separate decisions and remain live. |
| Alerts | 🟢 Live | Derived from live market thresholds | Generated from live price/peg movement, not a stored backend. |
| Network fee — Bitcoin | 🟢 Live | mempool.space | Real sat/vByte. |
| Network fees — ETH / BNB / Polygon / AVAX | 🟢 Live | keyless `eth_gasPrice` (publicnode) | Live gas amount × live token price (2026-08-21, `01d6bfe`). |
| Network fees — L2s (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism) | 🟡 Partial | static gas amount × live token price | **Estimate on purpose.** `eth_gasPrice` returns only the L2 execution price and omits the L1 data fee, which is most of what a rollup transaction actually costs — a live-looking number that is wrong by the majority of the total is worse than a labelled estimate. |
| Network fees — non-EVM (Solana, Tron, XRPL, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Cosmos, TON, NEAR) | 🟡 Partial | static gas amount × live token price | Gas amount is a **static estimate**; only the price is live. Labeled `estimate`. This is where the remaining work is. |
| Transfer withdrawal fees | 🟡 Partial | static table (`transferFees.ts`) | Hand-maintained, carries `lastVerified` + confidence (high ≤60d / medium ≤120d / low when stale). Stale ⇒ ranking degraded with an explicit caveat. |
| `chart` route | 🟡 Partial | CoinGecko market_chart | **Synthetic OHLC** (zero-range candles) now marked `synthetic: true`. **No consumers in the app** — use `/live-data/ohlcv` for real candles. |

### Crypto — staking, news, social
| Feature / Page | Status | Source | Notes |
|----------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Staking APR — stETH / rETH / mSOL / jitoSOL | 🟢 Live | Lido, Rocket Pool, Marinade, Jito | **jitoSOL was restored 2026-07-20**: the old `/api/v1/apy` endpoint 404s and had silently pinned it to a 7.5% static estimate — ~41% above the real 5.32%. Now reads `/api/v1/stake_pool_stats`. |
| Staking APR — all other providers | 🟡 Partial | static estimates | **47 of 51 rates** (re-measured 2026-07-29). PR #37 grew the catalog from 28 to 51 providers without adding live rate sources, so live coverage went 4/28 → **4/51**. Each estimate carries `sources[key] = 'estimate'`. Improving this ratio is the open work, not the catalog size. |
| Staking discovery | 🟢 Live | DefiLlama + Yearn + Pendle + Beefy | 95 pools. **Slow: ~18 s.** |
| News + sentiment + categories | 🟢 Live | 4 keyless publisher RSS feeds + optional keyed providers | **Verified 2026-07-29 (evening): 10 articles from 4 providers; `v1 news` 5 articles.** The outage earlier that day was **structural, not a feed failure**: every built-in crypto news provider required an API key, and CryptoPanic's free tier — the one carrying this — ended April 2026. With no key saved all four resolved to `disabled`, so the route found zero providers and returned `ok:false`, which `/api/v1/news` reported as "all news providers failed upstream" — blaming the upstream for a config state. Fixed by adding keyless RSS built-ins (CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, Decrypt, Bitcoin Magazine), matching what equities and macro already had, so the feed has a default that needs no key. Articles use `headline` (not `title`); sentiment/category are heuristic classifiers (labeled derived). |
| Social sentiment (crypto) | 🟡 Partial | Reddit **Atom/RSS** feeds | Reddit's JSON API 403s server-side; the `.rss` feeds work but 429 aggressively (~1 request per window per IP), so coverage is partial by nature. |
| Videos | 🟢 Live | RSS | 60 videos. |
| Video search / analyze | 🔑 Key-gated | YouTube Data API | Reports `configured: false`; returns empty rather than fabricating. |

### Crypto — portfolio & wallets
| Feature / Page | Status | Source | Notes |
|----------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Portfolio prices | 🟢 Live | CoinGecko | `source: live \| partial \| error`. |
| Portfolio history | 🔴 **FAILING (2026-07-29)** | CoinGecko history | **No historical prices, `source=error`.** The param validation is fine — the missing-params case still correctly returns HTTP 400 — so this is the upstream call, not the handler. Likely the same CoinGecko rate-limiting that fails `coin-discovery`. |
| Wallet — BTC / ETH / SOL / TRON / XRP | 🟢 Live | Public explorers + JSON-RPC | **ETH/EVM fixed 2026-07-20:** was hard-502ing on Ethereum and Polygon because each chain had a single RPC and `cloudflare-eth.com` / `polygon-rpc.com` both broke. Now walks a fallback ladder and reports the serving endpoint in `rpc`. All 7 EVM chains verified. |
| Exchange connections | ⚪ **Removed 2026-08-18 (RP-5)** | — | Exchange API-key linking was withdrawn on security grounds: plaintext `apiKey`/`apiSecret` at rest for a read-only balance view that watched addresses already approximate. Routes and credential store deleted; the wallet store's v2 migration drops persisted connection metadata. Do not reintroduce without a decision reversing RP-5. |
| Pump report metrics | 🟢 Live | derived | 20 metrics. `scan`/`investigate`/`chat` are POST-only (405 on GET is correct). |

### Equities module
| Feature / Page | Status | Source | Notes |
|----------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Quotes | 🟡 Key-gated _(was 🟢, pre-2026-08-06 measurement)_ | ladder: FMP → Finnhub → Twelve Data → Tiingo → Alpha Vantage → catalog | **Every live rung needs a key** since Yahoo was removed. With none configured, stocks and funds render catalog reference prices behind an amber `ref` tag and macro instruments render a dash. **Stooq was removed earlier** (2026-07-28) — 404s on every variant. |
| OHLCV / TA / backtests | 🟡 Key-gated _(was 🟢)_ | Tiingo → FMP | Both keyed. Route reports `source: 'none'` and the surfaces show their no-live-source state rather than synthetic candles. |
| Price chart | 🟡 Key-gated _(was 🟢)_ | Tiingo → FMP | Close-only series by design. Tiingo supplies `adjClose`, so charts and candles agree across a split. **Takes range vocab `6mo`, unlike its sibling `security-ohlcv` (`6M`)** — mismatched vocab returns 400. |
| Trailing returns | 🟡 Key-gated _(was 🟢)_ | Tiingo | One request per symbol now, so `?universe=` is **refused** rather than truncated, and `?symbols=` is capped at 60. Fund return screening/sorting disabled; per-page Returns columns still live. |
| Stock Registry universe | 🟡 Partial | **curated catalog fallback** | FMP `company-screener` is **PAID-only**; without it the registry is 79 hand-maintained names. P/E backfill from SEC XBRL frames only runs on the FMP path. |
| Equity screener / outliers | 🟡 Partial | derived from the above | Screens 66 evaluable names across 7 sectors — inherits the catalog's narrowness. Backs the `equity-screener` agent. |
| Market news | 🟡 Partial _(was 🟢)_ | MarketWatch / CNBC RSS | Keyless and unaffected in themselves. What went is the **per-ticker** feed — Yahoo's was the only free one — so symbol news is now these general wires filtered to articles that actually name the company. An empty result for a symbol is the honest answer, not a fault. |
| Stock social | 🟡 Partial | StockTwits + **Reddit (fixed 2026-07-20)** | Reddit was calling the `.json` API, which **403s 100% of the time server-side** — a permanently dead provider that looked like a quiet feed. Switched to the `.rss` Atom feeds already proven in the crypto route. **Starvation fixed 2026-07-22** (`lib/server/socialBlend.ts`, unit-tested): merging by recency let StockTwits — minutes old, against Reddit's hours — fill every slot at `limit ≤ 30`. The blend now allocates the budget round-robin across providers and orders the winners by recency, so the slower source keeps its share. **Separately, since the 2026-08-29 terms review, reddit.com is gated off** — its robots.txt disallows this app's agent — unless `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` is set, enforced in `pinnedFetch`. So expect StockTwits-only in server/CI environments, by policy rather than by bug. |
| SEC filings | 🟢 Live | SEC EDGAR | Keyless. |
| Company fundamentals / ratios | 🟢 Live | SEC EDGAR XBRL | AAPL rev $416B, net margin 26.9% — sanity-checked. |
| Company profile | 🟢 Live | SEC EDGAR + Wikipedia | |
| Market calendar | 🔑 Key-gated | FMP | Reports `configured: false`. Earnings calendar needs a free key; economic calendar needs a paid one. |

### ETFs & Funds module
| Feature / Page | Status | Source | Notes |
|----------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Fund universe | 🟢 Live | SEC + providers | 28,977 entries. **Slow: ~11 s, 14 MB payload** — payload slimmed 2026-07-30 (action item 11), pending re-measurement. |
| Fund holdings | 🟢 Live | SEC N-PORT (keyless, authoritative) | Verified full books: VOO 511, IVV 507, VTI 1500, QQQ 101, ARKK 46. |
| Fund holdings — UITs | 🟡 Partial | catalog | **SPY, and UITs generally, file no N-PORT**, so they correctly fall back to indicative top holdings. Not a bug. |
| Fund holdings history | 🔑 Key-gated | SEC N-PORT diff → FMP | Works only where an N-PORT series exists; no FMP key configured as fallback. |

### Macro Markets module
Shipped 2026-07-21 and **measured for the first time on 2026-07-29 (evening run)**. The harness
had no macro checks until that day, so these rows sat ⬜ Not measured for eight days while the
routes were in production — the doc gap and the harness gap were the same gap. Four checks now
cover the module; only the shared quote path is still inferred rather than observed.

| Feature / Page | Status | Source (measured) | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Macro news | 🟢 Live | 8 keyless RSS feeds (Investing.com ×3, OilPrice, FXStreet, MarketWatch, CNBC ×2) | `macro-news` — **20 articles across 3 pillars** (commodities, bonds, currencies) in 1.7s. Content-first pillar classifier; 14-day staleness cutoff. Note only 3 of 4 pillars were represented in this sample; the balanced merge caps each at ¼ of slots, so an empty pillar means that feed set returned nothing in-window, not that classification failed. Several of these publishers bot-block elsewhere in this report — expect per-feed variance by IP. |
| FX rates — official tier | 🟢 Live | ECB daily reference via frankfurter.dev (keyless) | `fx-rates` — **30 currencies**, `date=2026-07-29`, `source=frankfurter-ecb`. Confirms the 30-currency set is ECB's complete published list, not a subset. |
| FX rates — extended tier | 🟡 Partial | community `fawazahmed0/currency-api` (keyless) | `fx-rates-extended` — **124 of 126 allowlisted currencies priced; KPW and SYP unpriced upstream.** Classified FALLBACK by the harness, which is the honest reading: the tier works, two codes have no rate. North Korean won and Syrian pound are both effectively unquoted in open markets, so this is the source being accurate rather than broken. **Decided 2026-09-08: keep them, accepted as-is.** Dropping the two codes would make the harness report REAL, and that is the whole argument against it — the route's behaviour would be identical while the audit line got tidier, which is optimising the measurement rather than the thing measured. A user who picks KPW learns that nobody quotes it; a user who cannot find KPW learns nothing. The permanent FALLBACK on this row is therefore expected, not an open item. Labeled community-sourced in the UI, never blended with the ECB tier unattributed. |
| Treasury yield curve | 🟢 Live | treasury.gov daily par curve XML (keyless) | `treasury-yield-curve` — **13 maturities**, 2s10s=+0.45, 3m10y=+0.84, `shape=normal`. Both spreads positive and the curve un-inverted as of this run. 4h revalidate. |
| Commodity / currency / rate quotes | 🟡 Key-gated, expected partial _(never measured directly)_ | existing `security-quotes` ladder | **The surface the Yahoo removal hit hardest, and still the least-measured.** `GC=F` / `EURUSD=X` / `^TNX` were quoted keylessly and are **not** covered by Tiingo, so coverage now depends entirely on which keyed provider is configured. Unpriced renders a dash — the catalogs carry no reference prices by design. A dedicated check is now the highest-value gap to close. |
| Futures term structure (forward curve) | 🔴 Not available _(was 🟢, P2-O4)_ | — | Dated contract months (`CLZ26.NYM`) had exactly one reachable source and it was Yahoo. FMP/Tiingo/Finnhub/Twelve Data/Alpha Vantage carry continuous front-months at best; exchange settlement files are licensed. `/live-data/futures-curve` still resolves the months and returns `ok:false` with the reason, and `TermStructureCard` prints it — the section says why rather than vanishing. Front-month prices are unaffected. |
| CUSIP-level bond quotes | 🔴 Not available | — | Licensed data. Intentionally absent and stated on-page; this row needs no measurement. |

### Not available
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| TA — liquidation heatmap / OI depth / exchange flows | 🔴 Not available | Coinglass/Glassnode are paid. Shown as explicit "not available (paid feed)" rows. |
| TA — event markers (unlocks, CPI/FOMC) | 🟡 Partial | News events plotted from the live feed; token unlocks and macro prints need a paid calendar — explicitly omitted, not faked. |
| Peg deviation history | 🔴 Not available | No free historical peg series. Returns empty. |
| Per-row price sparklines | 🔴 Not available | No free per-asset trend source at list scale; shows "n/a". |
| Reports (AUM, risk tables) | 🔴 Not available | Explicit "not available" notice. |
| Backtests (crypto) | 🔴 Not available | Requires a backtesting backend; not present. Equity strategy backtests (`/equities/backtests`) DO work off live `security-ohlcv`. |
| `/live-data/tier` | 🔴 **Route does not exist** | The directory is empty and nothing references the path — tier data is client-side (`src/lib/tier.ts`). Listed in older inventories in error. |

## Reference data (legitimately static — NOT mock)

Not real-time and not fabricated; stable reference facts that belong in the app as static data:

- **Asset metadata catalog** — id, symbol, name, asset type, blockchain, contract address, issuer, description, website, whitepaper, peg target. (`lib/data/assetCatalog.ts`)
- **News categories** — the fixed taxonomy of category labels. (`lib/data/newsCategories.ts`)
- **Asset launch dates & notable historical events** — chart annotations. (`lib/data/priceHistoryMeta.ts`)
- **Network / address-format reference** — chains, address formats, examples. (`lib/data/transferFees.ts`)
- **Staking provider risk profiles** — qualitative risk dimensions per provider. (`lib/data/stakingProviders.ts`)
- **Equity / fund catalogs** — `equityCatalog.ts` (~79), `fundCatalog.ts` (~55). Legitimate reference data, but note they double as the **fallback** path for `stock-universe` and `fund-holdings`, which is where the silent-degradation risk comes from.

---

## Route conventions audit

Project convention (CLAUDE.md): every `/live-data` route needs `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`,
`next: { revalidate: N }` on each fetch, and `Promise.allSettled` for any multi-fetch.

- ✅ **`force-dynamic`** — all **56** route files comply (`chart` was the sole exception; fixed 2026-07-20).
  Count and compliance re-verified **statically** on 2026-07-28 (`find src/app/live-data -name route.ts`
  vs `grep -l "export const dynamic"`, 56/56). This one line needs no running server, so it is current
  even though the availability statuses above are not.
- ✅ **`revalidate`** — present on every outbound fetch in all routes that fetch.
- ✅ **`Promise.allSettled`** — resolved 2026-07-22. The earlier flag listed 8 routes found by grepping for
  multi-fetch without `allSettled`; reading them showed **7 were already correct and 1 had a real bug that
  `allSettled` would not have fixed**:
  - `markets`, `portfolio-prices`, `cbdc-data` — deliberate **sequential fallback ladders** (try provider A,
    fall back to B, then C), each leg try/caught. `allSettled` would be actively **wrong** here: it fires every
    provider in parallel, burning rate limit on calls the ladder exists to avoid.
  - `company-profile` — `Promise.all([SEC, wiki])` is safe because `fetchWikiSummary` is fail-silent (returns
    `null`). Only the SEC leg can reject, and that *should* fail the route: it is the primary data.
  - `stock-universe` — already has an explicit inner boundary so a SEC hiccup costs the P/E column, not the
    response. `wallet/exchange` and `config` are **not multi-fetch at all** — one exchange / one provider test
    per request, each try/caught.
  - `sec-filings` — **the one genuine bug.** Its archive-page walk is sequential by design (it stops as soon as
    `limit` is satisfied, so parallel fetching would request pages nobody asked for). A non-`ok` response broke
    the loop gracefully, but a *thrown* fetch propagated to the outer handler and **503'd the whole route,
    discarding the filings already collected from `recent`**. Now per-page try/catch: partial results return with
    `hasMore: true`. Verified by fault injection — old code 503 / 0 filings, new code 200 / 11 filings.

  Conclusion: the convention as stated ("`Promise.allSettled` for any multi-fetch") is too blunt. A sequential
  fallback ladder is a multi-fetch that must *not* be parallelised. What every multi-fetch actually needs is a
  **failure boundary that preserves partial results** — sometimes `allSettled`, sometimes try/catch per leg.

## Performance outliers

| Route | Latency | Note |
|-------|---------|------|
| `staking-discovery` | ~18 s **at the time of measurement** | 4 upstreams (DefiLlama, Yearn, Pendle, Beefy) — **bounded 2026-09-08.** The fan-out is parallel, so the response was gated by the slowest leg, and with no timeout "slowest" had no upper bound. Each upstream now gets a 6 s budget, and a TIMEOUT is not retried — the retry exists for upstreams that throw and immediately succeed, whereas retrying a slow one buys the same answer for twice the wait. The fan-out is `allSettled`, so a timed-out leg drops its pools and the other three still serve. **The new figure needs re-measuring on the owner's machine** — the bound is ~6 s, not a measurement. |
| `fund-universe` | ~11 s / **14 MB** | 28,977 entries in one payload — payload slimmed 2026-07-30 (see action item 11), size pending re-measurement; first-fetch latency is upstream, 24 h-cached after |
| `staking-rates` | ~6 s | 17 parallel upstreams with a 6 s per-fetch timeout |
| `stock-social` | ~6 s | Reddit RSS fetches frequently hit the 429 path |

---

## Refresh intervals (free tier)

CoinGecko's public API rate-limits to ~30 calls/minute, making **60 seconds the practical
minimum** for free-tier polling without hitting 429.

| Surface | Endpoint | Refresh interval | Stale after |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Technical Analysis — screener prices | `/live-data/markets` | 60 s | 60 s |
| Technical Analysis — chart (1H range) | `/live-data/ohlcv` | on demand | 60 s |
| Technical Analysis — chart (4H / 1M) | `/live-data/ohlcv` | on demand | 5 min |
| Technical Analysis — chart (3M / 6M / 1Y / MAX) | `/live-data/ohlcv` | on demand | 15 min |
| Asset prices / market data | `/live-data/markets` | 30 s | 30 s |
| Network fees | `/live-data/network-fees` | on demand | 5 min |
| Staking APRs | `/live-data/staking-rates` | on demand | 5 min |
| News | `/live-data/news` | on demand | 1 min |

> The chart price display is derived from the last candle's close — it updates whenever
> OHLCV refetches, not on a separate price tick.

## Action items tracked from this report

1. ✅ Classify every surface (this document).
2. ✅ Remove all mock generators; relocate legitimate reference data out of `lib/api/mock/`. There is no mock/demo data path.
3. ✅ Reports page confirmed to show "not available" (no live-mode mock leak).
4. ✅ De-duplicate network-fee logic into one source of truth (`lib/data/networkFees.ts`), consumed by both layers. Verified identical at runtime + by the audit's cross-layer checks.
5. ✅ Provenance primitive (`DataBadge`) wired into the transfer-fees page; fees carry `lastVerified` + staleness warning.
6. ✅ Network fee-feed **infrastructure** built (`FeeProvider` + `FEE_PROVIDERS` + BTC reference provider). Live EVM gas providers remain the next step to flip more 🟡 chains to 🟢.
7. ✅ **Audit harness classifies real vs fallback data** (`npm run audit`). Replaces the old pass/fail smoke test, which reported 43/43 green while two routes served static catalogs.
8. ✅ Surface data provenance in-app. Done — a canonical registry (`src/lib/data/dataSources.ts`) now powers the
   **/data-sources** page (in-app catalog), per-page `<SourceLine/>` badges, and the generated
   [`DATA-SOURCES.md`](./DATA-SOURCES.md). `npm run data-sources -- --verify` fails if a route fetches a host the
   registry doesn't name, so the docs/app can't silently drift from the code.
9. ⏳ **Get a paid FMP plan or a different universe source** — `stock-universe` and `stock-outliers` are the largest remaining fallback surface.
10. ✅ ~~**Fix Reddit starvation in `stock-social`**~~ Done 2026-07-22 — `lib/server/socialBlend.ts` allocates the
    response budget round-robin per provider (newest-first within each), then re-sorts by recency for display, so
    the feed still reads chronologically. Unused share flows to other providers, so one active source still fills
    the limit. Measured before → after at `limit=20`: **20/0 → 10/10** StockTwits/Reddit; at `limit=40`: 30/10 →
    20/20. `providers` now lists only sources that actually placed a signal in the response — previously it named
    Reddit at limit=20 while showing zero Reddit posts, which is what hid the starvation. 7 unit tests.
    ⚠ Separately: the `/equities/social` **page** currently never issues its query (stuck on "Fetching social
    signals…" while the app reports Offline/DISCONNECTED). Pre-existing and unrelated — the route and a direct
    fetch from that page both work; tracked separately.
11. 🔧 ~~Paginate `fund-universe` — 14 MB in one response.~~ **Payload fix shipped 2026-07-30,
    pending re-measurement.** Not pagination — that would have broken FundsClient's client-side
    screening, which needs the whole universe. The 14 MB was shape: ~29k uncurated funds each
    serialized as a full 18-field entry with 14 fields always null. Discovered funds now ship as
    compact `{symbol, name}` lists per type (`discoveredEtfList` / `discoveredMutualList`),
    hydrated client-side; `entries` carries only the 118 rich catalog rows, and the `?symbol=`
    lookup path is unchanged. Expected ~80% size cut; the ~11 s first fetch is upstream directory
    latency (24 h-cached thereafter) and is untouched. **Re-run the audit on the owner's machine
    to record the new size** — the container cannot reach NASDAQ/SEC.
12. ✅ ~~Bring the 8 bare-`Promise.all` routes onto `Promise.allSettled`.~~ Done 2026-07-22 — 7 were already
    correct (sequential fallback ladders that must not be parallelised, or not multi-fetch at all); the real
    bug was `sec-filings` discarding collected filings when an archive page threw. See the conventions audit above.
13. ✅ ~~**Regenerate this report** (audit finding H3).~~ Done 2026-07-29 on the owner's machine — see
    "Run of 2026-07-29" above. The code-derived half had landed 2026-07-28 (route count 51 → 56, the Stooq
    rung, a Macro section); this run supplied the measurements. It also corrected a claim this file had made
    without measuring: staking live coverage is **4 of 51**, not "better than 4 of 28".
14. ✅ ~~**News outage.**~~ **Fixed and verified 2026-07-29 (evening run):** `news` REAL with 10 articles
    from 4 providers, `v1 news` REAL with 5. The diagnosis first recorded here was wrong: "two code paths,
    one verdict, so this is the feeds". Both paths read the same route, and that route returned `ok:false`
    for a *config* reason — zero enabled providers — not a fetch failure. Every built-in crypto news
    provider required a key and CryptoPanic's free tier ended April 2026, so nothing keyless was left.
    Four keyless publisher RSS built-ins restore a default that works with no key at all.
15. ⏳ **Raise live staking coverage.** 4 of 51 rates are live (re-confirmed in the evening run). PR #37
    grew the catalog, not the live sources. The estimates are labeled honestly, but 92% of the table is
    estimated.
16. ✅ ~~**Re-run for Macro.**~~ Done 2026-07-29 (evening). 3 of 4 checks REAL, `fx-rates-extended`
    FALLBACK on two unquoted currencies (KPW, SYP). See the Macro Markets table.
17. ⏳ **Clear the CoinGecko rate-limit artifact.** `coin-discovery`, `portfolio-history` and `alerts` all
    fail together on free-tier 429s during a burst run, while `markets`/`coin-list`/`coin-search` in the
    same run succeed. Either set `COINGECKO_API_KEY` or pace the harness's CoinGecko checks — as it stands
    every full audit reports three failures that say nothing about the app's real availability, which
    devalues the failure list.
18. ⏳ **Add a macro quote check.** Commodity/currency/rate quotes are the one macro row still ⬜ Not
    measured: they are *inferred* to work because they share the `security-quotes` ladder, but no check
    exercises a macro instrument through it. Inference is what left the other four rows unmeasured for
    eight days.

## Validation

`npm run audit` (in `frontend/`, with the app running) is the full check; `npm run smoke`
is the fast CI subset; `npm run audit:strict` also fails on fallback/empty responses.
`npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` run clean (non-interactive, CI-ready).

_This file is maintained alongside the code. Update it whenever a data source is added,
removed, or changes status — and re-run `npm run audit` rather than editing statuses by hand._
