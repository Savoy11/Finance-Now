# Finance Now — Data Source Inventory

_Auto-generated from `src/lib/data/dataSources.ts` by `npm run data-sources`. **Do not hand-edit** —
change the registry and regenerate. This is the "where does the data come from" companion to
`DATA-AVAILABILITY.md` (which tracks whether each surface is live). The same registry powers the
in-app **/data-sources** page and the per-page provenance badges, so the app and the docs never diverge._

## Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Live** | Sourced from a real external provider at request time. |
| **Partial** | Some fields live, others static reference values or labeled estimates. |
| **Key-gated** | Needs an API key / paid plan the project may not have. Route reports this honestly. |
| **Derived** | Computed from other live data, not a single upstream. |
| **Not available** | No free real-time source; the UI shows an explicit "not available" notice. |

Provider tags: `key` = needs an API key · `paid` = needs a paid plan · untagged = keyless.

| On-chain wallet balances (BTC/ETH/SOL/TRON/XRP + EVM) | Live | Public explorers + JSON-RPC ladders | — | `/live-data/wallet/*` |

- **Crypto prices, market cap, volume, 24h change** — Prices live; coin metadata (name, chain, contract) is static reference data, not fabricated. Reference/fallback data: `lib/data/assetCatalog.ts (metadata)`.
- **Crypto OHLCV / candlestick charts** — Binance.com is 451 (geo-blocked) from many hosts, so candles come from the US mirror — a different venue. Serving venue recorded in the `venue` field.
- **Coin project profile (website, description)** — Two-rung ladder: CoinMarketCap when keyed (bulk, 1 credit/100 coins, identity resolved by lib/utils/coinIdentity.ts which declines rather than guesses), else CoinGecko per coin. The keyless rung is switchable off with FN_ALLOW_KEYLESS_COIN_PROFILES=false. Descriptions are sanitized to plain text, never rendered as HTML.
- **Global crypto aggregates (BTC dominance, total cap)** — Feeds the Cycle Context tab's dominance card. Nullable field by field, so a partial upstream answer serves what it carries.
- **Perp funding rates + open interest** — Binance futures (fapi) is 451 from many hosts; OKX is the working source.
- **Stablecoin reserves / collateralization** — Supply is live; composition breakdown is approximate / derived from chain distribution, not issuer attestation.
- **Alerts (depegs, large moves)** — Generated from live price/peg movement thresholds, not a stored backend.
- **Network / gas fees (16 chains)** — Live: Bitcoin (mempool.space sat/vByte) and the four EVM L1s — Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche — via keyless eth_gasPrice, priced at an assumed 65k-gas token transfer (live PRICE × assumed LIMIT, same shape as BTC’s live rate × assumed 250 vBytes). Arbitrum/Optimism/Base are deliberately NOT live: on OP-stack chains the L1 data fee usually dominates and eth_gasPrice reports only L2 execution, so a live-looking number would understate the true cost — they stay honest estimates. The remaining chains are a static gas amount × live token price, labeled `estimate` per network. Reference/fallback data: `lib/data/networkFees.ts (gas limits + fallback amounts)`.
- **Live exchange withdrawal fees (Transfer Fee Calculator overlay)** — Keyless public endpoints only (RP-5: no exchange API-key custody). Overlay-only — live rows update fees on routes the curated table already carries, never add routes. Rows are labeled live per-hop; the other 28 exchanges stay static with the staleness banner. Owner probe 2026-08-21: KuCoin + HTX confirmed live; Bybit removed (its endpoint 403s — authenticated, not public). Batch 2 (Bitget, Poloniex, LBank, Bitfinex, XT.com) added same day, NOT yet probed — remove any that fail like Bybit did. Also feeds withdrawal AVAILABILITY: a live-reported suspension blocks the route with attribution, while static rows are disclosed as assumed-open (availabilityExchangeIds is narrower than the live-fee source list — Bitfinex reports fees with no status field). Shared with /api/v1/transfer/routes via lib/server/withdrawFeeOverlay.ts. Reference/fallback data: `lib/data/transferFees.ts (the table being overlaid)`.
- **Staking APR/APY** — Liquid-staking/restaking protocols + native network rates are live (DefiLlama + protocol APIs + chain inflation). CeFi exchange rates are static estimates. Each rate carries sources[key] = "live" | "estimate". Reference/fallback data: `lib/data/stakingProviders.ts (risk profiles, fallback APRs)`.
- **Crypto price chart (legacy, internal)** — Synthesises zero-range OHLC from a price-only series (marked synthetic:true). No app consumers — /live-data/ohlcv provides real candles.
- **Crypto news + sentiment** — Multi-provider RSS/JSON merge. Sentiment/category are heuristic classifiers (labeled derived).
- **Crypto social sentiment** — What is live vs derived, since the row said only "partial": the Santiment and LunarCrush SOCIAL VOLUME/MENTION COUNTS are live, and both are KEY-GATED — without a key those signals are absent, not zero. The SENTIMENT LABELS are not a provider signal at all: they are a keyword classifier over the post text (derived). The Reddit score/upvote figure is not live either — Reddit’s Atom feed carries no score or upvote ratio at all, so the route sets a literal 0 as its “no score available” sentinel and leaves upvoteRatio undefined; both pages then render those badges only when present, so nothing displays rather than a fake zero. Reddit itself is doubly constrained: its JSON API 403s server-side, the .rss feeds 429 aggressively, and since the 2026-08-29 terms review its robots.txt disallows this app’s agent, so reddit.com is gated off in pinnedFetch unless REDDIT_CLIENT_ID is set.
- **Videos / video search** — RSS video list works keyless; search/analyze report configured:false without a key rather than fabricating.
- **Portfolio history** — Requires ids + date; returns HTTP 400 on missing/invalid params.
- **On-chain wallet balances (BTC/ETH/SOL/TRON/XRP + EVM)** — Each chain walks a fallback ladder of public RPC/explorer endpoints and reports the serving endpoint in `rpc`.

- **Stock / ETF / fund quotes** — Registry-driven provider ladder (Integrations page). EVERY live rung needs an API key since the keyless one was withdrawn on terms grounds (2026-08-06) — with no key, stocks and funds fall to catalog reference prices behind an amber `ref` tag, and macro instruments (no reference price by design) show a dash. Reference/fallback data: `lib/data/equityCatalog.ts`, `lib/data/fundCatalog.ts`.
- **Stock OHLCV / TA / backtests** — Both rungs are keyed. Without one the route returns source:"none" and the TA, backtest and candlestick surfaces show their no-live-source state rather than synthetic candles.
- **Trailing returns (1M/3M/YTD/1Y)** — One request per symbol now (the batched source was withdrawn), so the route serves up to 60 named symbols and REFUSES whole-universe requests rather than silently truncating. Screening and sorting funds by trailing return is off as a result; the Returns columns are still live for the visible page.
- **Stock market news** — General market wires only. The one free PER-TICKER feed was Yahoo’s and went on terms grounds, so symbol news is now these wires filtered to articles that actually name the company — an empty result is the honest answer when they haven’t covered it.
- **Stock social sentiment** — Reddit 403s from datacenter IPs without OAuth — expect StockTwits-heavy results server-side. Budget allocated round-robin so one active source still fills the limit.
- **Company fundamentals / ratios** — AAPL rev/net-margin sanity-checked against reported figures.
- **Stock Registry universe** — FMP screener is PAID-only; without a key the registry falls back to ~79 curated names. P/E backfilled from SEC XBRL frames on the FMP path only. Reference/fallback data: `lib/data/equityCatalog.ts (~79 names)`.
- **Equity screener / outliers** — Sector z-scores over whatever universe stock-universe returns — inherits its narrowness on the catalog fallback.
- **IPO calendar** — IPO_CALENDAR is on Alpha Vantage’s free tier — the only free source publishing forward listing DATES (SEC S-1 filings show intent, not timing). Reports configured:false without a key. Its 25 requests/day is a terms CONDITION, so the route caches 6h. Price ranges arrive as 0 when the issuer has not set one and are rendered as “not set”, never $0.
- **Market calendar (earnings / econ)** — Earnings needs a free FMP key; economic calendar needs a paid one. Reports configured:false without one.
- **Trade Risk Scorer (options)** — Every option-level figure is entered by the user — Finance Now carries NO options chain, because no source it may use publishes one (Cboe’s terms prohibit auto-extraction; Yahoo’s options endpoint required auth and Yahoo is now blocked outright on terms grounds). See docs/assessments/P2-O1-options-data.md. Only the underlying price is fetched, through the shared quote ladder, which is keyed. The score itself is this app’s computation, not any provider’s figure.

## ETFs & Funds

| Surface | Status | Provider(s) | Cadence | Route |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Fund universe | Live | [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/edgar) `www.sec.gov`<br>NASDAQ Trader `www.nasdaqtrader.com` | daily-cached | `/live-data/fund-universe` |

| Holdings quarter-over-quarter diff | Partial | [SEC N-PORT](https://www.sec.gov/edgar) `data.sec.gov`<br>FMP `financialmodelingprep.com` _(key)_ | — | `/live-data/fund-holdings-history` |

- **Fund universe** — Discovered funds ship as compact {symbol,name} rows (2026-07-30, audit follow-up F3). PAGINATION WAS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED in item 11, not deferred: the registry screens client-side, so a page-at-a-time API would filter as though it had seen the whole universe when it had seen fifty rows. The earlier ~11s / 14MB figure predates the compact shape and is not a current measurement — payload size is pending a re-measure on the owner’s machine.
- **ETF / fund holdings** — N-PORT is keyless and authoritative, and holdings are unaffected by the Yahoo removal. Two side panels are: SECTOR WEIGHTS now need an FMP key (N-PORT carries no GICS classification), and the stock/bond/cash ASSET MIX is DERIVED FROM N-PORT’s assetCat field (NT9) rather than having no source — the earlier "no source at all" note was overtaken by that work. It is therefore keyless and unaffected by the Yahoo removal, but absent for filers that publish no N-PORT (UITs such as SPY), where the section correctly does not render. UITs (e.g. SPY) file no N-PORT and correctly fall back to indicative top holdings.
- **Holdings quarter-over-quarter diff** — Works where an N-PORT series exists.

## Macro Markets

- **FX rates (official tier)** — ECB’s complete published set of ~30 reference currencies.
- **FX rates (extended tier, +127)** — Community-sourced, not ECB — the UI shows a distinct disclosure and never blends the two tiers without attribution.
- **Treasury par yield curve** — Official 13-maturity daily par curve (XML).
- **Macro news (commodities/bonds/FX)** — 8 keyless RSS feeds with a content-first pillar classifier.
- **Futures term structure (forward curve)** — Dated contract months (CLZ26.NYM style) priced through Yahoo’s v8 chart API, verified 9/9 across NYMEX/COMEX/CBOT by the P2-O1 audit (2026-08-05). Yahoo was withdrawn on terms grounds 2026-08-06 and nothing else the app can reach quotes a dated month — FMP/Tiingo/Finnhub/Twelve Data/Alpha Vantage carry continuous front-months at best, exchange settlement files are licensed. The route resolves the contract months and returns ok:false with the reason; the card states it on-page. Front-month prices are unaffected.
- **Commodity / FX / rate quotes + charts** — FUTURES and FX PAIRS still price through the equity quote/chart routes (no separate plumbing). The four YIELD INDICES no longer do: since D3 (2026-09-03) ^IRX/^FVX/^TNX/^TYX read the official treasury.gov par curve via lib/data/ratesFromCurve.ts — keyless, plain percent, published daily — after a probe found no free provider quotes them at all (FMP paywalls, Finnhub empty, Twelve Data 404, Alpha Vantage empty, Tiingo has no index space). ⚠ Of what remains, this is still the surface the Yahoo removal hit hardest: GC=F and EURUSD=X were quoted keylessly and are NOT covered by Tiingo, so coverage depends on the keyed provider you configure and is expected to be partial. Catalogs carry no reference prices, so anything unpriced renders an honest dash rather than a stale number. The FX converter and Treasury yield curve are keyless and unaffected. Reference/fallback data: `lib/data/commodityCatalog.ts`, `lib/data/currencyCatalog.ts`, `lib/data/ratesCatalog.ts`.

- **Watchlist (cross-module live prices)** — Prices split by instrument class: CoinGecko ids price through portfolio-prices, sec:-keyed stocks/funds/macro through the security-quotes ladder. Lists themselves are user data (Postgres), not a provider feed.
- **Compare (growth-of-100, window stats, correlation)** — Price series are provider data (Tiingo or FMP for stocks/funds, CoinGecko closes for crypto); the growth-of-100 normalization, window statistics, and correlation matrix are computed by Finance Now, not published figures. Comparing a stock against a macro instrument may now come back one-sided — the equity leg is keyed and the macro leg often uncovered since the Yahoo removal.
- **AI Daily Brief** — AI-generated text grounded in the user’s holdings and the same /live-data routes the UI reads. This is Finance Now’s own computation — not a publisher’s analysis — and inherits the freshness of whatever feeds the agent’s tools returned.
- **Portfolio Builder (allocations, drift, suitability)** — Allocations, bond ladders, diversification and suitability scores are Finance Now’s own computation (pure engine, vitest-tested) — not provider figures. Live prices enter only for drift-vs-actual monitoring; unpriced positions are excluded, never valued at cost. Reference/fallback data: `lib/data/portfolioBuilder.ts`, `lib/data/fundCatalog.ts`.
- **Global adoption / CBDC tracker** — De-routed (T5): mislabeled tracker on stale static data. /global-adoption redirects to /headlines. Kept for reference only.
- **Integrations connectivity test** — Not a data surface — it pings each provider from the Integrations page to report reachability/utilization.
