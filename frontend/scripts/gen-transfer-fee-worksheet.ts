/**
 * Generate a verification worksheet for the transfer-fee table (audit finding M4).
 *
 *   npm run fee-worksheet
 *
 * Writes two files to the repo root, both gitignored:
 *   transfer-fee-worksheet.csv  — one row per exchange×coin×network, for a spreadsheet
 *   transfer-fee-worksheet.md   — per-exchange summary + progress tracker
 *
 * Why this exists: `TRANSFER_FEES_LAST_VERIFIED` is 2025-06-01 and the table holds
 * ~560 entries. Re-verifying it by reading TypeScript is miserable and error-prone —
 * you lose your place, and nothing records what you already checked. The CSV gives
 * you the current value next to blank columns to fill in, so the job is comparing
 * rather than transcribing.
 *
 * The unit of work is ONE EXCHANGE, not one entry: you open an exchange's fee page
 * once and check every row it covers. Rows are sorted tier-1 first, then by
 * exchange, so the highest-traffic tables come first and you can stop at any
 * exchange boundary without leaving a half-checked table behind.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this script only reads. Nothing here bumps TRANSFER_FEES_LAST_VERIFIED.
 * That date means "the whole table was verified as of this day", so it can only be
 * moved by hand once every exchange is done. Bumping it after a partial pass is the
 * exact dishonesty the provenance machinery exists to prevent.

//
// ⚠ This is a JUDGEMENT about usage, not measured data and not a fee value.
// Getting the order wrong costs some wasted effort; it cannot make the table
