The CBN\'s primary goals were to improve financial inclusion in a country where over 35% of adults are unbanked and to reduce dependence on a volatile informal economy. Initial adoption was extremely low — only ~0.5% of Nigerians used it in its first year — largely because smartphone penetration and bank account requirements created barriers for the very population it targeted. In 2023 the CBN overhauled the eNaira with a USSD feature allowing transactions via basic mobile phones without internet access, which significantly broadened reach.

The wholesale pilot targets interbank settlement of government securities, where it could reduce settlement risk and collateral requirements. The retail pilot has expanded to 13 banks, 9 cities, and now includes non-bank payment service providers. Key design choices include token-based (not account-based) architecture for privacy and a programmable layer being tested for government subsidy distribution. India\'s motivation is partly strategic — the country is the world\'s largest recipient of remittances, and a cross-border digital rupee could reduce the ~5% average fee on those flows.',

Built on Hyperledger Besu — an enterprise Ethereum Virtual Machine — it is designed for tokenised asset settlement: real estate, government bonds, and agricultural receivables can be issued as on-chain tokens and settled against DREX in atomic transactions. The Banco Central do Brasil sees this as modernising Brazil\'s already advanced PIX instant payment system by adding programmability. The pilot included 16 financial institutions and tested smart-contract-based delivery-versus-payment. Privacy concerns around transaction visibility on a shared ledger have been a key design challenge, addressed through zero-knowledge proof experiments.',

A digital ruble operating on sovereign infrastructure gives Russia a payments channel that bypasses Western-controlled systems. The Bank of Russia began a pilot with 13 banks in August 2023, subsequently expanded to retail customers. Russia is also exploring cross-border use with China, India, and other BRICS members via direct ruble-to-yuan CBDC links that would reduce dollar dependency in trade settlement.

On the wholesale side, the UAE is a core participant in the BIS mBridge platform, which has processed live cross-border transactions between central banks in Asia and the Middle East. The retail component focuses on financial inclusion for the UAE\'s large expatriate workforce — remittances account for a significant share of personal outflows — and on reducing friction in e-commerce.

Its defining feature is offline functionality: the e-Cedi can be used without internet or electricity through NFC hardware cards, targeting rural communities in northern Ghana where network coverage is limited. The Bank of Ghana also wants to reduce the cost of printing and distributing physical cedi notes, which disproportionately burdens remote regions. The pilot tested peer-to-peer transfers, merchant payments, and government-to-person disbursements.

Helvetia Phase II (2023) integrated the wholesale CBDC directly into the SNB\'s existing RTGS system, settling tokenised bonds with commercial banks. The SNB has been emphatic that it sees no need for retail CBDC in Switzerland, given the country\'s efficient payment infrastructure, but considers wholesale CBDC important for the future of institutional digital asset markets. Project Mariana (with BIS, France, and Singapore) further tested automated market-maker-based FX settlement between wholesale CBDCs.',

    notes: 'The Banque de France has been one of the most active central banks in wholesale CBDC experimentation, running eight pilots between 2020 and 2023 covering interbank settlement, government bond issuance, cross-border payments, and automated market-maker FX. France participates in Project Mariana with BIS and the Swiss and Singapore central banks, and in the ECB\'s digital euro preparation phase for retail. The French pilots have demonstrated that wholesale CBDC can interoperate with commercial bank tokenised deposits and that atomic DvP (delivery versus payment) for digital securities is technically feasible at scale. France views wholesale CBDC as foundational infrastructure for European capital markets tokenisation.',

Development was paused during political turbulence and then significantly disrupted by the February 2022 Russian invasion. Despite the war, the NBU has continued CBDC research — seeing the e-Hryvnia as a potential tool for distributing government aid and social payments to displaced citizens, bypassing damaged physical infrastructure. Ukraine passed a virtual assets law in 2022 that created a regulatory framework supportive of digital currency innovation. The wartime context has added urgency: a digital hryvnia could help maintain monetary sovereignty if physical cash systems are further disrupted.',

Like Sweden, the motivation is the dramatic decline in cash usage: Norway ranks among the top three countries globally for cashless transactions, and Norges Bank is concerned about losing the public option of central bank money. The bank completed a four-phase research programme in 2024 and is now in a design phase focused on how a retail CBDC could coexist with the existing banking system. Norway participates in Project Icebreaker (with BIS, Israel, and Sweden) exploring cross-border retail CBDC payments.',

The Philippines has one of the most active retail digital payment ecosystems in Southeast Asia (GCash, Maya), so the BSP has been careful to position wholesale CBDC as infrastructure for banks rather than a consumer-facing product that competes with existing e-wallets. Financial inclusion — roughly 23% of adults remain unbanked despite high smartphone penetration — remains a consideration for future retail phases. The Philippines is also a top-five global remittance recipient, and a CBDC settlement layer could reduce the roughly $1.5B in annual remittance fees paid by overseas Filipino workers.',

Iran\'s motivation is unusually explicit: decades of US-led sanctions have cut Iran off from SWIFT and dollar-clearing systems, and a sovereign digital currency operating on domestic infrastructure could facilitate trade with sanctioned trading partners (Russia, Venezuela, and others) outside Western financial rails. Iran and Russia have discussed direct CBDC-to-CBDC links for bilateral trade settlement. Domestically, the Digital Rial also addresses hyperinflation erosion of trust in physical rial — the currency lost over 80% of its value between 2018 and 2023.',

The adoption of the US dollar as a semi-official parallel currency and widespread use of stablecoins (Argentina ranks among the top global crypto adopters) suggests that monetary trust, not technology, is the core challenge. The incoming Milei administration\'s dollarisation proposals further complicated the CBDC roadmap. Any Argentine CBDC would need to address severe trust deficits built up over repeated bank freezes and currency crises.',

Colombia\'s financial inclusion gap — roughly 30% of adults unbanked — provides motivation, though the rapid growth of digital wallet Nequi (owned by Bancolombia, with 20M+ users) and the expansion of the PSE instant payment system have reduced the urgency.

Morocco is in the process of liberalising its financial sector and passed a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework in 2023 — one of the first in Africa — which creates a more hospitable environment for digital currency development. The primary rationale is financial inclusion: roughly 29% of Moroccan adults lack bank accounts, and mobile money penetration (while growing) is lower than in Sub-Saharan Africa.
