// Upcoming IPOs for the equities module — Alpha Vantage IPO_CALENDAR, which
// returns listings expected over roughly the next three months.
//
// WHY THIS PROVIDER. It is the only source reachable on a FREE tier that
// publishes forward-looking listing dates. SEC EDGAR has the S-1 filings and is
// keyless and authoritative, but a registration statement says a company INTENDS
// to list, not when — the date is set at pricing, days ahead. So EDGAR answers a
// different question and is not a substitute here.
//
// PROVIDER LADDER, DELIBERATELY ONE RUNG DEEP FOR NOW. The project runs on free
// sources until release, then pays for whatever is needed so no field renders
// blank (owner, 2026-09-03). The shape below anticipates that: `source` is
// reported on every response, and a richer PAID rung (FMP's IPO calendar is the
// obvious candidate) is meant to be tried FIRST when its key is present, with
// Alpha Vantage remaining the free floor.
//
// That rung is NOT wired yet, on purpose. This environment cannot reach FMP to
// confirm its response shape, and parsing a feed nobody has seen is how a wrong
// number reaches a page — the same reason the SEC fee script ships with
// candidate tags and an --inspect mode rather than assumptions. Wiring it needs
// one live response to read; everything else here is ready for it.
//
// ⚠ RATE LIMIT IS A TERMS CONDITION, NOT JUST A QUOTA. The Alpha Vantage entry
// in lib/server/sourceTerms.ts is `conditional` with "Free tier is 25
// requests/day — do not exceed" written into its conditions. Hence the long
// revalidate below: an IPO calendar changes at most daily, and a short window
// would spend the day's allowance on re-fetching a list that has not moved.
// Do not lower it to make the page feel fresher.
