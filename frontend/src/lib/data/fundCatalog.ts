// ─── Provenance ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This table had no provenance machinery while its expense ratios were being
// computed on — by computeFeeDrag() below, by the Portfolio Builder's blended-ER
// and fee-projection math, and by reviewPlan()'s fee-creep check (W4-C7). A
// stale expense ratio there does not look stale: it comes out as a confident
// dollar figure in a 30-year projection.
//
// Dated by when the catalog was compiled AS A WHOLE (the 2026-07-20 build), not
// by its most recent partial edit. The currency and commodity proxy lineups were
// appended on 2026-07-21, but adding 20 rows does not re-verify the other 98 —
// see CLAUDE.md's note on exactly this failure.

//
// FEES SPOT-CHECKED 2026-09-01 — and the date above deliberately did NOT move.
// The expense ratios of the 89 funds that are '40 Act registrants were joined to
// the SEC's Mutual Fund Prospectus Risk/Return Summary data sets (public domain,
// the same licence class as the N-PORT holdings already used here) via the
// series/class CSV. 87 had a structured fee table; 55 matched, 22 were within a
// basis point, and these 10 were corrected to the filed prospectus figure:
//
//   FCNTX 0.39 -> 0.74   VWOB 0.20 -> 0.15   TAN  0.67 -> 0.70
//   IGV   0.41 -> 0.39   AGTHX 0.61 -> 0.59  QQQ  0.20 -> 0.18
//   VWELX 0.26 -> 0.24   VTEB 0.05 -> 0.03   VYM  0.06 -> 0.04
//   VIG   0.06 -> 0.04
//
// FCNTX is the one that mattered: at 0.39 the Fee Drag card understated the
// 30-year cost of holding Contrafund by roughly half.
//
// Why the stamp stays at 2026-07-20 anyway: this checked ONE field on 87 of 126
// rows. AUM, yield, inception, index and holdings were not re-verified on any
// row, and the 37 funds that are not '40 Act registrants (SPY, DIA, the bullion
// and commodity trusts, the CurrencyShares) file no fee table at all, so their
// expense ratios remain exactly as unverified as before. Moving the date would
// make 116 unchecked rows look freshly confirmed — the precise failure the
// paragraph above describes.
//
// ✅ RESOLVED 2026-09-10 — USO is 0.86, not 0.81. The third-party API was right.
//
// This entry read "KNOWN SUSPECT, deliberately NOT changed", on the grounds that
// USO is a commodity pool with no SEC fee table and therefore no primary source
// in hand. The first half is true and the conclusion was not: a commodity pool
// files no *structured* Risk/Return dataset, but it still files a PROSPECTUS,
// and that prospectus carries an ordinary fee table.
//
// From USO's 424B3 filed 2026-04-24 (CIK 1327068, accession 0002071876-26-000128),
// verbatim:
//
//     Annual Fund Operating Expenses
//       Management Fees                          0.45 %
//       Distribution Fees                        None
//       Other Fund Expenses                      0.41 %
//       Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses     0.86 %
//
// 0.45 + 0.41 = 0.86 — the components reconcile, so this is not one stray number.
//
// The lesson is about the ABSENCE of a source rather than the number: "not in the
// dataset we usually read" was treated as "not obtainable", and that reasoning
// held a wrong figure in place for months while the correct one sat in a public
// filing.
//
// ── T-386, 2026-09-10: that lead was followed, for all 37 ──
//
// `npm run fund-prospectus-fees` reads the same kind of filing for every fund the
// Risk/Return dataset cannot reach. Result: 19 confirmed unchanged, 3 flagged,
// 14 unresolved (their fee label is not one this script recognises — which is
// NOT evidence of anything; the filing still states a fee).
//
// Of the 3 flagged, careful reading left exactly ONE real error:
//
//   UNG   0.60 -> 1.17   WRONG, corrected. The filing itemises
//                        Management Fees 0.60% + Other Fund Expenses 0.57% =
//                        Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses 1.17%. The catalog
//                        had recorded the MANAGEMENT FEE as the expense ratio, so
//                        the app showed barely half the real cost of a fund whose
//                        fee is its main drawback. Same class of error as USO
//                        above, roughly twice the size.
//
//   DBC   0.87 vs 0.85   LEFT ALONE, deliberately.
//   UDN   0.77 vs 0.75   LEFT ALONE, deliberately.
//
// DBC and UDN are Invesco DB commodity pools that state fees narratively — "fees
// and expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately 0.85% per annum" — with
// no itemised Annual Fund Operating Expenses table anywhere in the prospectus.
// The catalog's figure is 0.02pp higher in both cases, which is the brokerage
// estimate their published ratios add on top. Both numbers are defensible and the
// catalog's is the more inclusive one, so changing it on the strength of the word
// "approximately" would trade a complete figure for a narrower one.
//
// ⚠ That is the reason this probe reports and never writes. It flagged three
// differences; only one was an error. Applied automatically, it would have made
// two funds less accurate to fix one.
//
// Full assessment and the per-fund workbook: the 2026-09-01 fund fee review.

 * Projected cost of a fund's fees against a 0.03% benchmark.

 * invested. It is not an annual fee and must not be modelled as one: a 5.75%
 * front load on £10,000 means £9,425 starts compounding, and the gap it opens
 * grows with the horizon rather than closing. Omitting it understates the cost
 * of the decision by the largest single number on the page — which is why it is
 * a parameter here rather than something the caller subtracts afterwards.
 *
 * It applies only to the fund side. The benchmark is a no-load index fund, so
 * charging it a load would hide the very difference this comparison exists to
 * show.
 *
 * Pass it only when the rate is VERIFIED (see SalesCharge.maxPct). An
 * unverified load must be disclosed in words, never guessed into the maths.
