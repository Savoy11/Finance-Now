// ─── Suite module registry ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Finance Now is organised as a suite of entitlement-gated modules (see docs/ROADMAP.md).
// Each module contributes a section of sidebar navigation and owns a set of
// route prefixes. The sidebar renders from this registry filtered by the
// user's entitlements; in local dev every module is enabled by default.
//
// Rules that keep module boundaries clean:
//  1. A module's pages import shared code only from components/ui,
//     components/charts, components/markets, lib/ core, and its own folders —
//     never from another module's internals.
//  2. Cross-module data flows through /live-data or /api/v1 routes, never
//     through direct imports of another module's page code.
//  3. Every optional module's pages are wrapped in <ModuleGate module="…">, at
//     the component boundary rather than inside the page's JSX, so a disabled
//     module never mounts the page and its queries never fire.

/**
 * Budget and Retirement were REMOVED on 2026-08-20 — owner decision: they will
 * be explored in a different tool. Their ids are gone from this union, so any
 * stale `enabled` flag for them in a browser's entitlement store is simply
 * ignored rather than resurrecting a module that no longer exists.
