/**
 * NT12 — boundary drift guard (approved P3-W2 decision session, 2026-08-17).
 *
 * Every boundary where a NUMBER or a LIST is restated outside the catalog that
 * owns it had drifted by the time the P3 review looked: v1 discovery said 16
 * coins / 16 networks while the API served 22/18, the MCP README said 12 tools
 * while the server shipped 13, and the app-assistant's system prompt described
 * the pre-suite app. Each was fixed by hand; none was prevented from recurring.
 *
 * This suite is the prevention. It does not test behaviour — it tests that the
 * app's self-descriptions still match the catalogs they describe. The specific
 * failure it exists to stop is the quiet one: a catalog grows, every restated
 * count silently becomes a lie, and the surfaces whose whole job is telling
 * consumers what exists are the last to know.
 *
 * When one of these fails, fix the DESCRIPTION, not the assertion — unless the
 * catalog genuinely shrank, in which case the description was right to change
 * and the assertion follows it.
 *
 * Deliberately reads source files as text rather than importing them: the MCP
 * server is a separate package with its own build, and the point is to check
 * what the shipped text SAYS, which an import would hide behind evaluation.
