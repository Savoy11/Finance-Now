/**
 * Reddit's robots.txt disallows our agent — observed first-hand by
 * `npm run terms:report` on the owner's machine, 2026-08-29, while the app was
 * reading reddit.com/r/*.rss on two routes. This gate is the response.
 *
 * The distinction these tests defend: a robots disallow is an INSTRUCTION, not
 * an interpretation of terms. It is enforced structurally rather than checked
 * at each call site, because a per-site check is bypassed by the next call site
 * someone adds.
