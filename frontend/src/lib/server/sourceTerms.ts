// SOURCE TERMS REGISTRY — "is Finance Now allowed to use this website?"
//
// Every external host the app fetches from has a dated entry here recording
// what that site's terms of use actually say about automated access and
// redistribution, and the verdict that follows. Two things consume it:
//
//   1. RUNTIME (deny-by-default for user-supplied URLs). `assertSourceAllowed`
//      is called from pinnedFetch, which is the only path an arbitrary,
//      user-entered feed URL can take. A host we have marked `prohibited` can
//      not be fetched at all, no matter how it was configured.
//   2. TEST TIME (regression guard for built-ins). `__tests__/sourceTerms.test`
//      walks every host in lib/data/dataSources.ts and fails the suite if one
//      is unregistered or prohibited. That is what stops a new /live-data route
//      from quietly introducing a source nobody checked.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS. Yahoo Finance was the app's keyless workhorse for equity,
// fund and macro quotes, charts, OHLCV, trailing returns, fund holdings and
// per-ticker news. It was reached through query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/… —
// undocumented endpoints backing Yahoo's own web app, with no published API
// terms granting third-party programmatic access, while Yahoo's Terms of
// Service prohibit automated access and the redistribution of content. It was
// removed on 2026-08-06 for that reason, and the entry below is what keeps it
// out: re-adding a Yahoo fetcher now fails at the socket, not in review.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS A COMPLIANCE RECORD, NOT LEGAL ADVICE. Each entry is this
// project's reading of a published document on a stated date. Terms change;
// `SOURCE_TERMS_REVIEW_AFTER_DAYS` is why entries go stale rather than silently
// aging. Use `probeSiteTerms()` (termsProbe.ts) to re-check a host, and read
// the document yourself before flipping a verdict.
//
// ⚠ ALMOST EVERY ENTRY HERE IS `seeded`, NOT `verified` — READ `review` BEFORE
// TRUSTING ONE. The registry was written in an environment whose network policy
// blocked every publisher and provider host at the gateway, so not one terms
// document could be opened while it was being authored. The entries are honest
// starting positions drawn from each provider's publicly documented posture
// (published API docs, documented free tiers, openly advertised RSS feeds) —
// they are NOT readings, and the first cut of this file wrongly presented them
// as such by giving them all a `verifiedAt` date.
//
// `npm run terms:report` runs the probe over every registered host and writes a
// review worksheet. Run it from the owner's machine, read the documents it
// links, and flip entries to `verified` as you go. Until then, treat a seeded
// `approved` or `conditional` as "nobody has objected yet", not as a clearance.
//
// ⚠ VERIFICATION IS HOST-DEPENDENT, like the data audits (see CLAUDE.md).
// Several publishers 403 datacenter IPs on their own legal pages, so a probe
// run from CI or a cloud box can report "couldn't read the terms" for a site
// that serves them fine from a residential connection. Re-verify on the
// owner's machine; never downgrade a verdict on the strength of a CI probe.
