// Server-side URL validation for user-supplied endpoints (custom providers).
// Prevents SSRF: the server must never be coaxed into fetching internal,
// loopback, link-local, or cloud-metadata addresses.
//
// Two layers, deliberately separate:
//
//   validatePublicHttpUrl()          — synchronous, string-level. Protocol,
//                                      credentials, and the hostname/IP literal.
//   validatePublicHttpUrlResolved()  — the above PLUS a DNS resolution, with
//                                      every returned address checked.
//
// The string layer alone was the M3 finding: a hostname is only text, so
// `evil.example.com A 169.254.169.254` sails through it. Anything that is
// about to *fetch* must use the resolving layer. The string layer stays for
// save-time validation (a config's URL should not be rejected because DNS
// happened to be down when the user clicked Save) and as the fast pre-check
// inside the resolving layer.
