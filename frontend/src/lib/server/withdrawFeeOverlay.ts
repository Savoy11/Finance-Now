// Lives here rather than in the route handler because TWO surfaces need it and
// they must not disagree: /live-data/withdraw-fees (the UI) and
// /api/v1/transfer/routes (agents + the MCP tool). Before this, v1 served the
// static table only — so an agent could tell a user a route was open on the
// strength of a 2025-06-01 snapshot while the UI, reading the same exchange's
// live API, showed it suspended.
//
// Keyless public endpoints only — RP-5 (no exchange API-key custody) stands.
// Availability is IP-dependent; `npm run fee-probe` is the owner-machine verdict.
